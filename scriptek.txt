Star Wars: A New hope
a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. war drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity. it is a period of civil war. rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire. during the battle, rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the death star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. pursued by the empire's sinister agents, princess leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... the awesome yellow planet of tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. a tiny silver spacecraft, a rebel blockade runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. it is pursed by a giant imperial stardestroyer. hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the imperial stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the rebel craft to disintegrate. int. rebel blockade runner - main passageway an explosion rocks the ship as two robots, artoo-detoo (r2- d2) and see-threepio (c-3po) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. both robots are old and battered. artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. his face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. he has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an art deco design. another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way. threepio did you hear that? they've shut down the main reactor. we'll be destroyed for sure. this is madness! rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. they aim their weapons toward the door. threepio we're doomed! the little r2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand. threepio there'll be no escape for the princess this time. artoo continues making beeping sounds. tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship. threepio what's that? ext. spacecraft in space the imperial craft has easily overtaken the rebel blockade runner. the smaller rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant imperial starship. int. rebel blockade runner the nervous rebel troopers aim their weapons. suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor. in a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. the deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. laserbolts hit several rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. an explosion hits near the robots. threepio i should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister... artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots. ext. tatooine - desert wasteland - day a death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. the tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, luke skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. his shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. a light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. he is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. the little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. a bright sparkle in the morning sky catches luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. he stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). he motions for the tiny robot to follow him. luke hurry up! come with me! what are you waiting for?! get in gear! the robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. luke throws his arms up in disgust. exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly. int. rebel blockade runner - main hallway the awesome, seven-foot-tall dark lord of the sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. this is darth vader, right hand of the emperor. his face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the imperial stormtroopers. everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the rebel troops. several of the rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic. int. rebel blockade runner a woman's hand puts a card into an opening in artoo's dome. artoo makes beeping sounds. int. rebel blockade runner threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. artoo is nowhere in sight. the pitiful screams of the doomed rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance. threepio artoo! artoo-detoo, where are you? a familiar clanking sound attacks threepio's attention and he spots little artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove. a beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of artoo. surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion. threepio at last! where have you been? stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance. threepio they're heading in this direction. what are we going to do? we'll be sent to the spice mine of kessel or smashed into who knows what! artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. threepio chases after him. threepio wait a minute, where are you going? artoo responds with electronic beeps. int. rebel blockade runner - corridor the evil darth vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. he grabs a wounded rebel officer by the neck as an imperial officer rushes up to the dark lord. imperial officer the death star plans are not in the main computer. vader squeezes the neck of the rebel officer, who struggles in vain. vader where are those transmissions you intercepted? vader lifts the rebel off his feet by his throat. vader what have you done with those plans? rebel officer we intercepted no transmissions. aaah... this is a consular ship. were on a diplomatic mission. vader if this is a consular ship... were is the ambassador? the rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the dark lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops. vader commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the ambassador. i want her alive! the stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways. int. rebel blockade runner - subhallway the lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. she is princess leia organa, a member of the alderaan senate. the fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. one of the troopers spots her. trooper there she is! set for stun! leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. she starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. the troopers inspect her inert body. trooper she'll be all right. inform lord vader we have a prisoner. int. rebel blockade runner - subhallway artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. he snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. the stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod. threepio hey, you're not permitted in there. it's restricted. you'll be deactivated for sure.. artoo beeps something to him. threepio don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! now come out before somebody sees you. artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform. threepio secret mission? what plans? what are you talking about? i'm not getting in there! artoo isn't happy with threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily. a new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. flames lick at threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod. threepio i'm going to regret this. int. imperial stardestroyer on the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken rebel spacecraft. chief pilot there goes another one. captain hold your fire. there are no life forms. it must have been short- circuited. int. lifepod artoo and threepio look out at the receding imperial starship. stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy. threepio that's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. artoo beeps an assuring response. threepio are you sure this things safe? ext. tatooine - anchorhead settlement - power station - day heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. luke pilots his landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. an old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at luke as he flies past. woman i've told you kids to slow down! int. power station - day luke bursts into the power station, waking the fixer, a rugged mechanic and camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. they grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly. fixer did i hear a young noise blast through here? camie it was just wormie on another rampage. luke bounces into a small room behind the office where deak and windy, two tough boys about the same age as luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. his flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. a robot repairs some equipment in the background. luke shape it up you guys!... biggs? luke's surprise at the appearance of biggs gives way to great joy and emotion. they give each other a great bear hug. luke i didn't know you were back! when did you get in? biggs just now. i wanted to surprise you, hot shot. i thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. (he laughs) luke the academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission? biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony. biggs of course i got it. signed aboard the rand ecliptic last week. first mate biggs darklighter at your service... (he salutes) ...i just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons. everyone laughs. the dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it. luke i almost forgot. there's a battle going on! right here in our system. come and look! deak not again! forget it. ext. tatooine - anchorhead - settlement - power station - day the group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. camie and the fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens. luke there they are! biggs takes the binoculars from luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. through the binoculars biggs sees two small silver specks. biggs that's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! probably a freighter-tanker refueling. luke but there was a lot of firing earlier... camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process. luke grabs them. luke hey, easy with those... camie don't worry about it, wormie. the fixer gives luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation. fixer i keep telling you, the rebellion is a long way from here. i doubt if the empire would even fight to keep this system. believe me luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing... luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. the group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about luke's ineptitude. int. rebel blockade runner - hallway princess leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. they stop in a smoky hallway as darth vader emerges from the shadows. the sinister dark lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move. leia lord vader, i should have known. only you could be so bold. the imperial senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... vader don't play games with me, your highness. you weren't on any mercy mission this time. you passed directly through a restricted system. several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. leia i don't know what you're talking about. i'm a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan... vader you're a part of the rebel alliance... and a traitor. take her away! leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. an imperial commander turns to vader. commander holding her is dangerous. if word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate. vader i have traced the rebel spies to her. now she is my only link to find their secret base! commander she'll die before she tells you anything. vader leave that to me. send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! another imperial officer approaches vader and the commander. they stop and snap to attention. second officer lord vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! and no transmissions were made. an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. vader turns to the commander. vader she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. send a detachment down to retrieve them. see to it personally, commander. there'll be no one to stop us this time. commander yes, sir. ext. space the imperial stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet tatooine. ext. tatooine - desert jundland, or "no man's land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. the two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. the lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand. threepio how did i get into this mess? i really don't know how. we seem to be made to suffer. it's our lot in life. artoo answers with beeping sounds. threepio i've got to rest before i fall apart. my joints are almost frozen. artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds. threepio what a desolate place this is. suddenly artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. threepio stops and yells at him. threepio where are you going? a stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot. threepio well, i'm not going that way. it's much too rocky. this way is much easier. artoo counters with a long whistle. threepio what makes you think there are settlements over there? artoo continues to make beeping sounds. threepio don't get technical with me. artoo continues to make beeping sounds. threepio what mission? what are you talking about? i've had just about enough of you! go that way! you'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea. threepio and don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. he turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas. threepio no more adventures. i'm not going that way. artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains. ext. tatooine - dune sea threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. he looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas. threepio that malfunctioning little twerp. this is all his fault! he tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. in a huff of anger and frustration, threepio knocks the sand from his joints. his plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him. threepio wait, what's that? a transport! i'm saved! the bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport. threepio over here! help! please, help! ext. tatooine - anchorhead settlement - power station - day luke and biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. fixer and the others can be heard working inside. luke (very animated) ...so i cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak's trail. i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments. as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad. uncle owen was pretty upset. he grounded me for the rest of the season. you should have been there... it was fantastic. biggs you ought to take it easy luke. you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley, but those little skyhoppers are dangerous. keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall. luke look who's talking. now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. you've gotten soft in the city... biggs i've missed you kid. luke well, things haven't been the same since you left, biggs. it's been so... quiet. biggs looks around then leans close to luke. biggs luke, i didn't come back just to say good-bye... i shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one i can trust... and if i don't come back, i want somebody to know. luke's eyes are wide with biggs' seriousness and loyalty. luke what are you talking about? biggs i made some friends at the academy. (he whispers) ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the alliance... luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless. luke join the rebellion?! are you kidding! how? biggs quiet down will ya! you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater! luke i'm sorry. i'm quiet. (he whispers) listen how quiet i am. you can barely hear me... biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues. biggs my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact. luke you're crazy! you could wander around forever trying to find them. biggs i know it's a long shot, but if i don't find them i'll do what i can on my own... it's what we always talked about. luke, i'm not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service. the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side -- the side i believe in. luke and i'm stuck here... biggs i thought you were going to the academy next term. you'll get your chance to get off this rock. luke not likely! i had to cancel my application. there has been a lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of anchorhead. biggs your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sandpeople with one blaster. luke i know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. he needs me for just one more season. i can't leave him now. biggs i feel for you, luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. what good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the empire?... you know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the empire. luke it couldn't happen here. you said it yourself. the empire won't bother with this rock. biggs things always change. luke i wish i was going... are you going to be around long? biggs no, i'm leaving in the morning... luke then i guess i won't see you. biggs maybe someday... i'll keep a lookout. luke well, i'll be at the academy next season... after that who knows. i won't be drafted into the imperial starfleet that's for sure... take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend i've got. biggs so long, luke. biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sunset the gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. he hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. in the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. a little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. the unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. he manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. his bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. out of the rocks scurry three jawas, no taller than artoo. they holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. they wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. they hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sandcrawler - sunset the eight jawas carry artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house. they weld a small disk on the side of artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine. the filthy little jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport. int. sandcrawler - hold area it is dim inside the hold area of the sandcrawler. artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. the narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. he lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber. int. sandcrawler - prison area artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. in the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. a voice of recognition calls out from the gloom. threepio artoo-detoo! it's you! it's you! a battered threepio scrambles up to artoo and embraces him. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sandcrawler - sunset the enormous sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. ext. tatooine - desert - day four imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought artoo and threepio to tatooine. a trooper yells to an officer some distance away. first trooper someone was in the pod. the tracks go off in this direction. a second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper. second trooper look, sir -- droids. ext. tatooine - dunes the sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. int. sandcrawler threepio and artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. artoo appears to be shut off. threepio wake up! wake up! suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. threepio's fist bangs the head of artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. at the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots. threepio we're doomed. a jawa starts moving toward them. threepio do you think they'll melt us down? artoo responds, making beeping sounds. threepio don't shoot! don't shoot! will this never end? ext. tatooine - desert - lars homestead - afternoon the jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including artoo and threepio, in front of the enormous sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. the jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. the shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps owen lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. his reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. as the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, luke skywalker. one of the vile little jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. a voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. luke goes over to the edge and sees his aunt beru standing in the main courtyard. beru luke, tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce. luke it looks like we don't have much of a choice but i'll remind him. luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the jawa leader. owen i have no need for a protocol droid. threepio (quickly) sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why i've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... owen what i really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. threepio vaporators! sir -- my first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. you could say... owen do you speak bocce? threepio of course i can, sir. it's like a second language for me... i'm as fluent in bocce... owen all right shut up! (turning to jawa) i'll take this one. threepio shutting up, sir. owen luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. luke but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters... owen you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. now come on, get to it! luke all right, come on! and the red one, come on. well, come on, red, let's go. as the jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the sandcrawler, artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend threepio. he is restrained by a slimy jawa, who zaps him with a control box. owen is negotiating with the head jawa. luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly. luke uncle owen... owen yeah? luke this r2 unit has a bad motivator. look! owen (to the head jawa) hey, what're you trying to push on us? the jawa goes into a loud spiel. meanwhile, artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. he lets out with a low whistle. threepio taps luke on the shoulder. threepio (pointing to artoo) excuse me, sir, but that r2 unit is in prime condition. a real bargain. luke uncle owen... owen yeah? luke what about that one? owen (to jawa) what about that blue one? we'll take that one. with a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for artoo. luke yeah, take it away. threepio uh, i'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. he really is in first-class condition. i've worked with him before. here he comes. owen pays off the whining jawa as luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry. luke okay, let's go. threepio (to artoo) now, don't you forget this! why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! int. lars homestead - garage area - late afternoon the garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. near the battered landspeeder little artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face. threepio thank the maker! this oil bath is going to feel so good. i've got such a bad case of dust contamination, i can barely move! artoo beeps a muffled reply. luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. finally luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench. luke it just isn't fair. oh, biggs is right. i'm never gonna get out of here! threepio is there anything i might do to help? luke glances at the battered robot. a bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face. luke well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! threepio i don't think so, sir. i'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. not on this planet, anyways. as a matter of fact, i'm not even sure which planet i'm on. luke well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. threepio i see, sir. luke uh, you can call me luke. threepio i see, sir luke. luke (laughing) just luke. threepio and i am see-threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, artoo-detoo. luke hello. artoo beeps in response. luke unplugs artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. luke you got a lot of carbon scoring here. it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. threepio with all we've been through, sometimes i'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all. luke you know of the rebellion against the empire? threepio that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. luke have you been in many battles? threepio several, i think. actually, there's not much to tell. i'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. well, not at making them interesting, anyways. luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from artoo's neck joint. he uses a larger pick. luke well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. were you on a cruiser or... the fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending luke tumbling head over heels. he sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of leia organa, the rebel senator, being projected from the face of little artoo. the image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. luke's mouth hangs open in awe. leia help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my only hope. luke what's this? artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for threepio to translate. leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. threepio what is what?!? he asked you a question... (pointing to leia) what is that? artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. he looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for threepio to translate. leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. leia help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my only hope. help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my only hope. threepio oh, he says it's nothing, sir. merely a malfunction. old data. pay it no mind. luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl. luke who is she? she's beautiful. threepio i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir. leia help me, obi-wan kenobi... threepio i think she was a passenger on our last voyage. a person of some importance, sir -- i believe. our captain was attached to... luke is there more to this recording? luke reaches out for artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle. threepio behave yourself, artoo. you're going to get us in trouble. it's all right, you can trust him. he's our new master. artoo whistles and beeps a long message to threepio. threepio he says he's the property of obi-wan kenobi, a resident of these parts. and it's a private message for him. quite frankly, sir i don't know what he's talking about. our last master was captain antilles, but with what we've been through, this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric. luke obi-wan kenobi? i wonder if he means old ben kenobi? threepio i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? luke well, i don't know anyone named obi- wan, but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea. he's kind of a strange old hermit. luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments. luke i wonder who she is. it sounds like she's in trouble. i'd better play back the whole thing. artoo beeps something to threepio. threepio he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. he suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what threepio has been saying. luke h'm? oh, yeah, well, i guess you're too small to run away on me if i take this off! okay. luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off artoo's side. luke there you go. the princess immediately disappears... luke well, wait a minute. where'd she go? bring her back! play back the entire message. artoo beeps an innocent reply as threepio sits up in embarrassment. threepio what message? the one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! a women's voice calls out from another room. aunt beru luke? luke! come to dinner! luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot. luke all right, i'll be right there, aunt beru. threepio i'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. luke tosses artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room. luke well, see what you can do with him. i'll be right back. threepio (to artoo) just you reconsider playing that message for him. artoo beeps in response. threepio no, i don't think he likes you at all. artoo beeps. threepio no, i don't like you either. int. lars homestead - dining area luke's aunt beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen. she puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area. luke sits with his uncle owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as aunt beru carries in a bowl of red grain. luke you know, i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen. owen what makes you think that? luke well, i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him. he says he belongs to someone called obi-wan kenobi. owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself. luke i thought he might have meant old ben. do you know what he's talking about? well, i wonder if he's related to ben. owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger. owen that old man's just a crazy old wizard. tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed. that'll be the end of it. it belongs to us now. luke but what if this obi-wan comes looking for him? owen he won't, i don't think he exists any more. he died about the same time as your father. luke he knew my father? owen i told you to forget it. your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. luke yes, sir. i think those new droids are going to work out fine. in fact, i, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. and if these new droids do work out, i want to transmit my application to the academy this year. owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. owen you mean the next semester before harvest? luke sure, there're more than enough droids. owen harvest is when i need you the most. only one more season. this year we'll make enough on the harvest so i'll be able to hire some more hands. and then you can go to the academy next year. luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle. owen you must understand i need you here, luke. luke but it's a whole 'nother year. owen look, it's only one more season. luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands. luke yeah, that's what you said last year when biggs and tank left. aunt beru where are you going? luke it looks like i'm going nowhere. i have to finish cleaning those droids. resigned to his fate, luke paddles out of the room. owen mechanically finishes his dinner. aunt beru owen, he can't stay here forever. most of his friends have gone. it means so much to him. owen i'll make it up to him next year. i promise. aunt beru luke's just not a farmer, owen. he has too much of his father in him. owen that's what i'm afraid of. ext. tatooine - lars homestead the giant twin suns of tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. int. lars homestead - garage luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. he takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the jawas were carrying. he activates the box, which creates a low hum, and threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the skyhopper spaceship. luke what are you doing hiding there? threepio stumbles forward, but artoo is still nowhere in sight. threepio it wasn't my fault, sir. please don't deactivate me. i told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. luke oh, no! luke races out of the garage followed by threepio. ext. tatooine - lars homestead luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars. threepio that r2 unit has always been a problem. these astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. even i can't understand their logic at times. luke how could i be so stupid? he's nowhere in sight. blast it! threepio pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? luke it's too dangerous with all the sandpeople around. we'll have to wait until morning. owen yells up from the homestead plaza. owen luke, i'm shutting the power down for the night. luke all right, i'll be there in a few minutes. boy, am i gonna get it. he takes one final look across the dim horizon. luke you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. threepio oh, he excels at that, sir. int. lars homestead - plaza morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. the idyll is broken be the yelling of uncle owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead. owen luke? luke? luke? where could he be loafing now! int. lars homestead - kitchen the interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as aunt beru prepares the morning breakfast. owen enters in a huff. owen have you seen luke this morning? aunt beru he said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. owen uh? did he take those two new droids with him? aunt beru i think so. owen well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! ext. tatooine - desert wasteland - luke's speeder - day the rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as threepio pilots the sleek landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. int./ext. luke's speeder - desert wasteland - traveling - day luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment. luke (yelling) how's that. threepio signals that is fine and luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut. luke old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but i don't see how that r2 unit could have come this far. we must have missed him. uncle owen isn't going to take this very well. threepio sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault. luke (brightening) sure. he needs you. he'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so... threepio deactivate! well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt... luke wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. it looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. ext. tatooine - rock mesa - dune sea - coastline - day from high on a rock mesa, the tiny landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. one of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired. the sandpeople, or tusken raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. the second tusken raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. ext. tatooine - rock mesa - canyon the tusken raider approaches two large banthas standing tied to a rock. the monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. the tusken raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - floor the speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little artoo. luke hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? the little droid whistles a feeble reply, as threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway. threepio master luke here is your rightful owner. we'll have no more of this obi-wan kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. you're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. luke well, come on. it's getting late. i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up. threepio if you don't mind my saying so, sir, i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop. luke no, he's not going to try anything. suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams. luke what's wrong with him now? threepio oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south. luke sandpeople! or worst! come on, let's have a look. come on. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - ridge - day luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. he spots the two riderless banthas. threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer. luke there are two banthas down there but i don't see any... wait a second, they're sandpeople all right. i can see one of them now. luke watches the distant tusken raider through his electrobinoculars. suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. before luke or threepio can react, a large, gruesome tusken raider looms over them. threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. he can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain. the towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. but luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. the terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. the sinister raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh. ext. tatooine - rock canyon - floor - day artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious sandpeople walk past carrying the inert luke skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. the sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. suddenly they stop. then everything is quiet for a few moments. a great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the sandpeople fleeing in terror. artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over luke. his ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. ben kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. artoo makes a slight sound and ben turns and looks right at him. ben hello there! come here my little friend. don't be afraid. artoo waddles over to were luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. ben puts his hand on luke's forehead and he begins to come around. ben don't worry, he'll be all right. luke what happened? ben rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. you're fortunate you're still in one piece. luke ben? ben kenobi! boy, am i glad to see you! ben the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. tell me young luke, what brings you out this far? luke oh, this little droid! i think he's searching for his former master... i've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. he claims to be the property of an obi-wan kenobi. is he a relative of yours? do you know who he's talking about? ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard. ben obi-wan kenobi... obi-wan? now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time... a long time. luke i think my uncle knew him. he said he was dead. ben oh, he's not dead, not... not yet. luke you know him! ben well of course, of course i know him. he's me! i haven't gone by the name obi-wan since oh, before you were born. luke then the droid does belong to you. ben don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. very interesting... he suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs. ben i think we better get indoors. the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. luke sits up and rubs his head. artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing luke to remember something. he looks around. luke threepio! ext. tatooine - sand pit - rock mesa - day little artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. luke and ben stand over a very dented and tangled threepio lying half buried in the sand. one of his arms has broken off. luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on. threepio where am i? i must have taken a bad step... luke can you stand? we've got to get out of here before the sandpeople return. threepio i don't think i can make it. you go on, master luke. there's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. i'm done for. artoo makes a beeping sound. luke no, you're not. what kind of talk is that? luke and ben help the battered robot to his feet. little artoo watches from the top of the pit. ben glances around suspiciously. sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air. ben quickly, son... they're on the move. int. kenobi's dwelling the small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. luke is in one corner repairing threepio's arm, as old ben sits thinking. luke no, my father didn't fight in the wars. he was a navigator on a spice freighter. ben that's what your uncle told you. he didn't hold with your father's ideals. thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. luke you fought in the clone wars? ben yes, i was once a jedi knight the same as your father. luke i wish i'd known him. ben he was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. i understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. and he was a good friend. which reminds me... ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. as luke finishes repairing threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, threepio looks at him nervously. luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. ben shuffles up and presents luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it. ben i have something here for you. your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. he feared you might follow old obi-wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. threepio sir, if you'll not be needing me, i'll close down for awhile. luke sure, go ahead. ben hands luke the saber. luke what is it? ben your fathers lightsaber. this is the weapon of a jedi knight. not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. luke pushes a button on the handle. a long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. the light plays across the ceiling. ben an elegant weapon for a more civilized time. for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic. before the dark times, before the empire. luke hasn't really been listening. luke how did my father die? ben a young jedi named darth vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights. he betrayed and murdered your father. now the jedi are all but extinct. vader was seduced by the dark side of the force. luke the force? ben well, the force is what gives a jedi his power. it's an energy field created by all living things. it surrounds us and penetrates us. it binds the galaxy together. artoo makes beeping sounds. ben now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. and where you come from. luke i saw part of the message he was... luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young rebel princess is projected from artoo's face. ben i seem to have found it. luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes. leia general kenobi, years ago you served my father in the clone wars. now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire. i regret that i am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and i'm afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed. i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit. my father will know how to retrieve it. you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan. this is our most desperate hour. help me, obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope. there is a little static and the transmission is cut short. old ben leans back and scratches his head. he silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. luke has stars in his eyes. ben you must learn the ways of the force if you're to come with me to alderaan. luke (laughing) alderaan? i'm not going to alderaan. i've got to go home. it's late, i'm in for it as it is. ben i need your help, luke. she needs your help. i'm getting too old for this sort of thing. luke i can't get involved! i've got work to do! it's not that i like the empire. i hate it! but there's nothing i can do about it right now. it's such a long way from here. ben that's your uncle talking. luke (sighing) oh, god, my uncle. how am i ever going to explain this? ben learn about the force, luke. luke look, i can take you as far as anchorhead. you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you're going. ben you must do what you feel is right, of course. ext. space. an imperial stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the death star! int. death star - conference room eight imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. commander tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking. tagge until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. the rebel alliance is too well equipped. they're more dangerous than you realize. the bitter admiral motti twists nervously in his chair. motti dangerous to your starfleet, commander, not to this battle station! tagge the rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial senate as long as.... suddenly all heads turn as commander tagge's speech is cut short and the grand moff tarkin, governor of the imperial outland regions, enters. he is followed by his powerful ally, the sith lord, darth vader. all of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. the dark lord stands behind him. tarkin the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us. i've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away. tagge that's impossible! how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? tarkin the regional governors now have direct control over territories. fear will keep the local systems in line. fear of this battle station. tagge and what of the rebellion? if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. vader the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. motti any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. this station is now the ultimate power in the universe. i suggest we use it! vader don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force. motti don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, lord vader. your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel's hidden fort... suddenly motti chokes and starts to turn blue under vader's spell. vader i find your lack of faith disturbing. tarkin enough of this! vader, release him! vader as you wish. tarkin this bickering is pointless. lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke. ext. tatooine - wasteland the speeder stops before what remains of the huge jawas sandcrawler. luke and ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies. luke it looks like sandpeople did this, all right. look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. it's just... i never heard of them hitting anything this big before. ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks. ben they didn't. but we are meant to think they did. these tracks are side by side. sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. luke these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio. ben and these blast points, too accurate for sandpeople. only imperial stormtroopers are so precise. luke why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas? luke looks back at the speeder where artoo and threepio are inspecting the dead jawas, and put two and two together. luke if they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. and that would lead them home! luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it. ben wait, luke! it's too dangerous. luke races off leaving ben and the two robots alone with the burning sandcrawler. ext. tatooine - wasteland luke races across the wasteland in his battered landspeeder. ext. tatooine - lars homestead the speeder roars up to the burning homestead. luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place. luke uncle owen! aunt beru! uncle owen! luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. he is stunned, and cannot speak. hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him. ext. space imperial tie fighter races toward the death star. int. death star - detention corridor two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several imperial guards to enter. princess leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by darth vader. vader and, now your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base. the torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches princess leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. the door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. the muffled screams of the rebel princess are barely heard. ext. tatooine - wasteland there is a large bonfire of jawa bodies blazing in front of the sandcrawler as ben and the robots finish burning the dead. luke drives up in the speeder and ben walks over to him. ben there's nothing you could have done, luke, had you been there. you'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the empire. luke i want to come with you to alderaan. there's nothing here for me now. i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father. ext. tatooine - wasteland the landspeeder with luke, artoo, threepio, and ben in it zooms across the desert. the speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at mos eisley. it is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. a harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where ben is standing. ben mos eisley spaceport. you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. we must be cautious. ben looks over at luke, who gives the old jedi a determined smile. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street the speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. a trooper questions luke. trooper how long have you had these droids? luke about three or four seasons. ben they're for sale if you want them. trooper let me see your identification. luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his id while ben speaks to the trooper in a very controlled voice. ben you don't need to see his identification. trooper we don't need to see his identification. ben these are not the droids your looking for. trooper these are not the droids we're looking for. ben he can go about his business. trooper you can go about your business. ben (to luke) move along. trooper move along. move along. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street the speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. a jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder. threepio i can't abide these jawas. disgusting creatures. as luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the jawa away. luke go on, go on. i can't understand how we got by those troopers. i thought we were dead. ben the force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. you will find it a powerful ally. luke do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to alderaan? ben well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. only watch your step. this place can be a little rough. luke i'm ready for anything. threepio come along, artoo. int. tatooine - mos eisley - cantina the young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow ben kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. the murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. at first the sight is horrifying. one-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. a huge, rough-looking bartender stops luke and the robots. bartender we don't serve their kind here! luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift. luke what? bartender your droids. they'll have to wait outside. we don't want them here. luke looks at old ben, who is busy talking to one of the galactic pirates. he notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare. luke pats threepio on the shoulder. luke listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. we don't want any trouble. threepio i heartily agree with you sir. threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks. ben is standing next to chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. his large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. he is a two-hundred-year-old wookiee and a sight to behold. ben speaks to the wookiee, pointing to luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between ben and the giant wookiee. luke is terrified but tries not to show it. he quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever. a large, multiple-eyed creature gives luke a rough shove. creature negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? the hideous freak is obviously drunk. luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. a short, grubby human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity. human he doesn't like you. luke i'm sorry. human i don't like you either. the big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer. human don't insult us. you just watch yourself. we're wanted men. i have the death sentence in twelve systems. luke i'll be careful than. human you'll be dead. the rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. his three adversaries ready their weapons. old ben moves in behind luke. ben this little one isn't worth the effort. come let me buy you something... a powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. with a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old ben. the bartender panics. bartender no blasters! no blaster! with astounding agility old ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. the rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand. the entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. the cantina goes back to normal, although ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. ben points the the wookiee. ben this is chewbacca. he's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street threepio paces in front of the cantina as artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid. a creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street. threepio i don't like the look of this. int. tatooine - mos eisley - cantina strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows ben and chewbacca to a booth where han solo is sitting. han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. a mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure. han han solo. i'm captain of the millennium falcon. chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the alderaan system. ben yes, indeed. if it's a fast ship. han fast ship? you've never heard of the millennium falcon? ben should i have? han it's the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! ben reacts to solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation. han i've outrun imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. i'm talking about the big corellian ships now. she's fast enough for you, old man. what's the cargo? ben only passengers. myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. han what is it? some kind of local trouble? ben let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements. han well, that's the trick, isn't it? and it's going to cost you something extra. ten thousand in advance. luke ten thousand? we could almost buy our own ship for that! han but who's going to fly it, kid! you? luke you bet i could. i'm not such a bad pilot myself! we don't have to sit here and listen... ben we haven't that much with us. but we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach alderaan. han seventeen, huh! han ponders this for a few moments. han okay. you guys got yourself a ship. we'll leave as soon as you're ready. docking bay ninety-four. ben ninety-four. han looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. ben and luke turn around to see four imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. the bartender points to the booth. trooper all right, we'll check it out. the stormtroopers look over at the booth but luke and ben are gone. the bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement. han seventeen thousand! those guys must really be desperate. this could really save my neck. get back to the ship and get her ready. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street ben you'll have to sell your speeder. luke that's okay. i'm never coming back to this planet again. int. mos eisley - cantina as han is about to leave, greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. the creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into english subtitles. greedo going somewhere, solo? han yes, greedo. as a matter of fact, i was just going to see your boss. tell jabba that i've got his money. han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him. greedo it's too late. you should have paid him when you had the chance. jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. i'm lucky i found you first. han yeah, but this time i got the money. greedo if you give it to me, i might forget i found you. han i don't have it with me. tell jabba... greedo jabba's through with you. he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser. han even i get boarded sometimes. do you think i had a choice? han solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table. greedo you can tell that to jabba. he may only take your ship. han over my dead body. greedo that's the idea. i've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. han yes, i'll bet you have. suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement. han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves. han sorry about the mess. ext. space several tie fighters approach the death star. int. death star - control room vader her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. it will be some time before we can extract any information from her. an imperial officer interrupts the meeting. imperial officer the final check-out is complete. all systems are operational. what course shall we set? tarkin perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. vader what do you mean? tarkin i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. (to soldier) set your course for princess leia's home planet of alderaan. trooper with pleasure. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds. threepio lock the door, artoo. one of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway. the door slides open a crack and threepio peeks out. artoo is barely visible in the background. trooper all right, check that side of the street. it's secure. move on to the next door. the door opens, threepio moves into the doorway. threepio i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you. i don't know what all the trouble is about, but i'm sure it must be your fault. artoo makes beeping sounds. threepio you watch your language! ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street - alleyway - used speeder lot ben and luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving luke some coins. luke he says it's the best he can do. since the xp-38 came out, they're just not in demand. ben it will be enough. ben and luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. a darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley. ben if the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. int. docking bay 94 - day jabba the hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. he is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth. jabba come on out, solo! a voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see han solo and the giant wookiee, chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight. han i've been waiting for you, jabba. jabba i expected you would be. han i'm not the type to run. jabba (fatherly-smooth) han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that... after all we've been through together. han you sent greedo to blast me. jabba (mock surprise) han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. you're too valuable to fry. he was only relaying my concern at your delays. he wasn't going to blast you. han i think he thought he was. next time don't send one of those twerps. if you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself. jabba han, han! if only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand i just can't make an exception. where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship? it's not good business. han you know, even i get boarded sometimes, jabba. i had no choice, but i've got a charter now and i can pay you back, plus a little extra. i just need some more time. jabba (to his men) put your blasters away. han, my boy, i'm only doing this because you're the best and i need you. so, for an extra, say twenty percent i'll give you a little more time... but this is it. if you disappoint me again, i'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life. han jabba, i'll pay you because it's my pleasure. ext. docking port entry - alleyway chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to docking bay 94. ben, luke, and the robots make their way up the street. chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. the darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot. he stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter. int. mos eisley spaceport - docking bay 94 chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is docking bay 94. resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship. luke what a piece of junk. the tall figure of han solo comes down the boarding ramp. han she'll make point five beyond the speed of light. she may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. i've added some special modifications myself. luke scratches his head. it's obvious he isn't sure about all this. chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow. han we're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. the group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning han solo. int. millennium falcon chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship. int. mos eisley spaceport - docking bay 94 luke, ben, threepio, and artoo move toward the millennium falcon passing solo. threepio hello, sir. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - street eight imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature. trooper which way? the darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay. trooper all right, men. load your weapons! int. mos eisley spaceport - docking bay 94] the troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance. trooper stop that ship! han solo looks up and sees the imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. several of the troopers fire at han as he ducks into the spaceship. trooper blast 'em! han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. the pirateship engines whine as han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut. int. millennium falcon han chewie, get us out of here! the group straps in for take off. threepio oh, my. i'd forgotten how much i hate space travel. ext. tatooine - mos eisley - streets the half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han climbs into the pilot's chair next to chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope. ext. space - planet tatooine the corellian pirateship zooms from tatooine into space. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han frantically types information into the ship's computer. little artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away. han it looks like an imperial cruiser. our passengers must be hotter than i thought. try and hold them off. angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed. ext. space - planet tatooine the millennium falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet, tatooine. it is followed by two huge imperial stardestroyers. int. millennium falcon - cockpit over the shoulders of chewbacca and han, we can see the galaxy spread before them. luke and ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where han continues his calculation. han stay sharp! there are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off. luke why don't you outrun them? i thought you said this thing was fast. han watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. we'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. besides, i know a few maneuvers. we'll lose them! ext. space - planet tatooine imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit the ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window. han here's where the fun begins! ben how long before you can make the jump to light speed? han it'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. the ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it. luke are you kidding? at the rate they're gaining... han traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? the ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash. luke what's that flashing? han we're losing our deflector shield. go strap yourself in, i'm going to make the jump to light speed. the galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier. stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace. ext. space the millennium falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second. ext. death star alderaan looms behind the death star battlestation. int. death star - control room admiral motti enters the quiet control room and bows before governor tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet. motti we've entered the alderaan system. vader and two stormtroopers enter with princess leia. her hands are bound. leia governor tarkin, i should have expected to find you holding vader's leash. i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board. tarkin charming to the last. you don't know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life! leia i surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! tarkin princess leia, before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. no star system will dare oppose the emperor now. leia the more you tighten your grip, tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. tarkin not after we demonstrate the power of this station. in a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, i have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of alderaan. leia no! alderaan is peaceful. we have no weapons. you can't possibly... tarkin you would prefer another target? a military target? then name the system! tarkin waves menacingly toward leia. tarkin i grow tired of asking this. so it'll be the last time. where is the rebel base? leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to alderaan. leia (softly) dantooine. leia lowers her head. leia they're on dantooine. tarkin there. you see lord vader, she can be reasonable. (addressing motti) continue with the operation. you may fire when ready. leia what? tarkin you're far too trusting. dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. but don't worry. we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. leia no! int. death star - blast chamber vader commence primary ignition. a button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. a hooded imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. another lever is pulled. vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. a huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward alderaan. the small green planet of alderaan is blown into space dust. int. millennium falcon - central hold area ben watches luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot. ben suddenly turns away and sits down. he falters, seems almost faint. luke are you all right? what's wrong? ben i felt a great disturbance in the force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. i fear something terrible has happened. ben rubs his forehead. he seems to drift into a trance. then he fixes his gaze on luke. ben you'd better get on with your exercises. han solo enters the room. han well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs. i told you i'd outrun 'em. luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber. han don't everyone thank me at once. threepio watches chewbacca and artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board. han anyway, we should be at alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head. threepio now be careful, artoo. artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. a sudden frown crosses chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge wookiee. threepio he made a fair move. screaming about it won't help you. han (interrupting) let him have it. it's not wise to upset a wookiee. threepio but sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. han that's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. wookiees are known to do that. threepio i see your point, sir. i suggest a new strategy, artoo. let the wookiee win. luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. a humming lightsaber is held high over his head. ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. han watches with a bit of smugness. ben remember, a jedi can feel the force flowing through him. luke you mean it controls your actions? ben partially. but it also obeys your commands. suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. the ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of luke's face. luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. it slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. it hits luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. han lets loose with a burst of laughter. han hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. luke you don't believe in the force, do you? han kid, i've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. i've seen a lot of strange stuff, but i've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. there's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. ben smiles quietly. han it's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. ben i suggest you try it again, luke. ben places a large helmet on luke's head which covers his eyes. ben this time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. luke (laughing) with the blast shield down, i can't even see. how am i supposed to fight? ben your eyes can deceive you. don't trust them. han skeptically shakes his head as ben throws the seeker into the air. the ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits luke square on the seat of the pants. he lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker. ben stretch out with your feelings. luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. the seeker makes a dive at luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. the ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position. ben you see, you can do it. han i call it luck. ben in my experience, there's no such thing as luck. han look, going good against remotes is one thing. going good against the living? that's something else. solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. han looks like we're coming up on alderaan. han and chewbacca head back to the cockpit. luke you know, i did feel something. i could almost see the remote. ben that's good. you have taken your first step into a larger world. int. death star - conference room imperial officer cass stands before governor tarkin and the evil dark lord darth vader. tarkin yes. officer cass our scout ships have reached dantooine. they found the remains of a rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. tarkin she lied! she lied to us! vader i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion. tarkin terminate her... immediately! ext. hyperspace the pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han stand by, chewie, here we go. cut in the sublight engines. han pulls back on a control lever. outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. han what the...? aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. some kind of asteroid collision. it's not on any of the charts. the wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit. luke what's going on? han our position is correct, except... no, alderaan! luke what do you mean? where is it? han thats what i'm trying to tell you, kid. it ain't there. it's been totally blown away. luke what? how? ben moves into the cockpit behind luke as the ship begins to settle down. ben destroyed... by the empire! han the entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. it'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than i've... a signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming. han there's another ship coming in. luke maybe they know what happened. ben it's an imperial fighter. chewbacca barks his concern. a huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. a tiny, finned imperial tie fighter races past the cockpit window. luke it followed us! ben no. it's a short range fighter. han there aren't any bases around here. where did it come from? ext. space the fighter races past the corellian pirateship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit luke it sure is leaving in a big hurry. if they identify us, we're in big trouble. han not if i can help it. chewie...jam it's transmissions. ben it'd be as well to let it go. it's too far out of range. han not for long... ext. space the pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the imperial tie fighter. int. millennium falcon - cockpit the tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. in the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the tie ship is heading for it. ben stands behind chewbacca. ben a fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. luke it must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. han well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. ext. space the tie fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. int. millennium falcon - cockpit the distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. luke look at him. he's headed for that small moon. han i think i can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range. the small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station. ben that's no moon! it's a space station. han it's too big to be a space station. luke i have a very bad feeling about this. han yeah, i think your right. full reverse! chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. the pirateship shudders and the tie fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station. luke why are we still moving towards it? han we're caught in a tractor beam! it's pulling us in! luke but there's gotta be something you can do! han there's nothin' i can do about it, kid. i'm in full power. i'm going to have to shut down. but they're not going to get me without a fight! ben kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder. ben you can't win. but there are alternatives to fighting. int. millennium falcon - death star as the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. ext. death star - huge port doors the helpless millennium falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons. voice over death star intercom clear bay twenty-three-seven. we are opening the magnetic field. int. death star - docking bay 2037 the pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the death star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area. officer to you stations! (to another officer) come with me. int. death star - hallway stormtroopers run to their posts. int. death star - hangar 2037 a line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire. officer close all outboard shields! close all outboard shields! int. death star - conference room tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz. tarkin yes. voice (over intercom) we've captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system. it's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley. vader they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. she may yet be of some use to us. int. death star - docking bay 2037 vader and a commander approach the troops as an officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft. voice (over intercom) unlock one-five-seven and nine. release charges. officer (to vader) there's no one on board, sir. according to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. it must be a decoy, sir. several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. vader did you find any droids? officer no, sir. if there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. vader send a scanning crew on board. i want every part of this ship checked. officer yes, sir. vader i sense something... a presence i haven't felt since... vader turns quickly and exits the hangar. officer get me a scanning crew in here on the double. i want every part of this ship checked! int. millennium falcon - hallway a trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. in a few moments all is quiet. the muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing han solo and luke. ben kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. luke boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. han i use them for smuggling. i never thought i'd be smuggling myself in them. this is ridiculous. even if i could take off, i'd never get past the tractor beam. ben leave that to me! han damn fool. i knew that you were going to say that! ben who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? han shakes his head, muttering to himself. chewbacca agrees. int. death star - main forward bay the crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp. trooper the ship's all yours. if the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. all right, let's go. the crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below. han's voice hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? the stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard. int. death star - forward bay - command office in a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a gantry officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. he speaks into the comlink. gantry officer tx-four-one-two. why aren't you at your post? tx-four-one-two, do you copy? a stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. the gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look. gantry officer take over. we've got a bad transmitter. i'll see what i can do. as the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering chewbacca. the gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. with a bone- chilling howl, the giant wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. the aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by han, dressed as an imperial stormtrooper. ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. luke quickly removes his helmet. luke you know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. han bring them on! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. threepio we found the computer outlet, sir. ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. he begins to inspect it carefully. threepio and artoo look over the control panel. artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly. ben plug in. he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network. artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. after a few moments, he beeps something. threepio he says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. the computer monitor flashes readouts. threepio the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. ben studies the data on the monitor readout. ben i don't think you boys can help. i must go alone. han whatever you say. i've done more that i bargained for on this trip already. luke i want to go with you. ben be patient, luke. stay and watch over the droids. luke but he can... ben they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan. your destiny lies along a different path than mine. the force will be with you... always! ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway. chewbacca barks a comment and han shakes his head in agreement. han boy you said it, chewie. han looks at luke. han where did you dig up that old fossil? luke ben is a great man. han yeah, great at getting us into trouble. luke i didn't hear you give any ideas... han well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... luke who do you think... suddenly artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. luke goes over to him. luke what is it? threepio i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir. he says "i found her", and keeps repeating, "she's here." luke well, who... who has he found? artoo whistles a frantic reply. threepio princess leia. luke the princess? she's here? han princess? what's going on? threepio level five. detention block a a-twenty- three. i'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. luke oh, no! we've got to do something. han what are you talking about? luke the droid belongs to her. she's the one in the message... we've got to help her. han now, look, don't get any funny ideas. the old man wants us to wait right here. luke but he didn't know she was here. look, will you just find a way back into the detention block? han i'm not going anywhere. luke they're going to execute her. look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. now all you want to do is stay. han marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind. luke but they're going to kill her! han better her than me... luke she's rich. chewbacca growls. han rich? luke yes. rich, powerful! listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... han what? luke well more wealth that you can imagine. han i don't know, i can imagine quite a bit! luke you'll get it! han i better! luke you will... han all right, kid. but you'd better be right about this. han looks at chewie, who grunts a short grunt. luke all right. han what's your plan? luke uh... threepio, hand me those binders there will you? luke moves toward chewbacca with electronic cuffs. luke okay. now, i'm going to put these on you. chewie lets out a hideous growl. luke okay. han, you put these on. luke sheepishly hands the binders to han. han don't worry, chewie. i think i know what he has in mind. the wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as han binds him with the electronic cuffs. threepio master luke, sir! pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should artoo and i do if we're discovered here? luke lock the door! han and hope they don't have blasters. threepio that isn't very reassuring. luke and han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant imperial death star. int. death star - detention area - elevator tube han and luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. only a few give the giant wookiee a curious glance. finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters. luke i can't see a thing in this helmet. a bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by han. the door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube. int. death star - main hallway several imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. they pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to threepio but with an insect face. at the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of ben kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. his appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. no one in the hallway seems to notice him. int. death star - interior elevator - detention security area luke and han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. the giant wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. guards and laser gates are everywhere. han whispers to luke under his breath. han this is not going to work. luke why didn't you say so before? han i did say so before! int. detention area elevator doors open. a tall, grim looking officer approaches the trio. officer where are you taking this... thing? chewie growls a bit at the remark but han nudges him to shut up. luke prisoner transfer from block one-one- three-eight. officer i wasn't notified. i'll have to clear it. the officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. there are only three other troopers in the area. luke and han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. han unfastens one of chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to luke. suddenly chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. he grabs han's laser rifle. han look out! he's loose! luke he's going to pull us all apart. han go get him! the startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. luke and han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying wookiee. their barrage of laserfire misses chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the imperial guards. the officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. he quickly checks the computer readout. han we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. you go get her. i'll hold them here. luke races down one of the cell corridors. han speaks into the buzzing comlink. han (sounding official) everything is under control. situation normal. intercom voice what happened? han (getting nervous) uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. we're fine. we're all fine here, now, thank you. how are you? intercom voice we're sending a squad up. han uh, uh, negative. we had a reactor leak here now. give us a few minutes to lock it down. large leak... very dangerous. intercom voice who is this? what's your operating number? han blasts the comlink and it explodes. han boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) luke! we're going to have company! int. death star - cell row luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol. when the smoke clears, luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. she had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open. leia (finally) aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it. luke what? oh... the uniform. i'm luke skywalker. i'm here to rescue you. leia you're who? luke i'm here to rescue you. i've got your r2 unit. i'm here with ben kenobi. leia ben kenobi is here! where is he? luke come on! int. death star - conference room darth vader paces the room as governor tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table. vader he is here... tarkin obi-wan kenobi! what makes you think so? vader a tremor in the force. the last time i felt it was in the presence of my old master. tarkin surely he must be dead by now. vader don't underestimate the power of the force. tarkin the jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. you, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. there is a quiet buzz on the comlink. tarkin yes. intercom voice governor tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block a a-twenty- three. tarkin the princess! put all sections on alert! vader obi-wan is here. the force is with him. tarkin if you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. vader escape is not his plan. i must face him alone. int. death star - detention area - hallway an ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door. han chewie! chewbacca responds with a growling noise. han get behind me! get behind me! a series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several imperial troops begin to emerge. han and chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame. they turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with luke and leia rushing toward them. han can't get out that way. leia looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. han (sarcastically) maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor. luke see-threepio! see-threepio! threepio (over comlink) yes sir? luke we've been cut off! are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... what was that? i didn't copy! int. death star - main bay gantry - control tower threepio paces the control center as little artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak. threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter. threepio i said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. the main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted. someone begins banging on the door. trooper voice open up in there! threepio oh, no! int. death star - detention corridor luke and leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. han and chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. the laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor. luke there isn't any other way out. han i can't hold them off forever! now what? leia this is some rescue. when you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? han (pointing to luke) he's the brains, sweetheart. luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders. luke well, i didn't... the princess grabs luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to han, almost frying him. han what the hell are you doing? leia somebody has to save our skins. into the garbage chute, wise guy. she jumps through the narrow opening as han and chewbacca look on in amazement. chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something. han get in there you big furry oaf! i don't care what you smell! get in there and don't worry about it. han gives him a kick and the wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. luke and han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening. han wonderful girl! either i'm going to kill her or i'm beginning to like her. get in there! luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone. int. death star - garbage room han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. he finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. it won't budge. han (sarcastically) oh! the garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. what an incredible smell you've discovered! let's get out of here! get away from there... luke no! wait! han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. the laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face. luke will you forget it? i already tried it. it's magnetically sealed! leia put that thing away! you're going to get us all killed. han absolutely, your worship. look, i had everything under control until you led us down here. you know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. leia it could be worse... a loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. han and luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. the wookiee is cowering near one of the walls. han it's worse. luke there's something alive in here! han that's your imagination. luke something just moves past my leg! look! did you see that? han what? luke help! suddenly luke is yanked under the garbage. han luke! luke! luke! solo tries to get to luke. luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. a membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat. leia luke! leia extends a long pipe toward him. leia luke, luke, grab a hold of this. luke blast it, will you! my gun's jammed. han where? luke anywhere! oh!! solo fires his gun downward. luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle. han luke! luke! suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. then everything is deathly quiet. han and leia give each other a worried look as chewbacca howls in the corner. with a rush of bubbles and muck luke suddenly bobs to the surface. leia grab him! luke seems to be released by the thing. leia what happened? luke i don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared... han i've got a very bad feeling about this. before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the rebels. luke the walls are moving! leia don't just stand there. try to brace it with something. they place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. the situation doesn't look too good. luke wait a minute! luke pulls out his comlink. luke threepio! come in threepio! threepio! where could he be? int. death star - main gantry - command office a soft buzzer and the muted voice of luke calling out for see-threepio can be heard on threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. artoo and threepio are nowhere in sight. suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber. first trooper take over! (pointing to the dead officer) see to him! look there! a trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. see-threepio and artoo-detoo are inside. artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office. threepio they're madmen! they're heading for the prison level. if you hurry, you might catch them. first officer (to his troops) follow me! you stand guard. the troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office. threepio (to artoo) come on! the guard aims a blaster at them. threepio oh! all this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. if you don't mind, i'd like to take him down to maintenance. trooper all right. the guard nods and threepio, with little artoo in tow, hurries out the door. int. death star - garbage room as the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller. chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. han is leaning back against the other wall. garbage is snapping and popping. luke is trying to reach threepio. luke threepio! come in, threepio! threepio! han and leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. leia begins to sink into the trash. han get to the top! leia i can't luke where could he be? threepio! threepio, will you come in? int. death star - main forward bay - service panel threepio they aren't here! something must have happened to them. see if they've been captured. little artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot. threepio hurry! int. death star - garbage room the walls are only feet apart. leia and han are braced against the walls. the princess is frightened. they look at each other. leia reaches out and takes han's hand and she holds it tightly. she's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body. han one thing's for sure. we're all going to be a lot thinner! (to leia) get on top of it! leia i'm trying! int. death star - main forward bay - service panel threepio (to artoo) thank goodness, they haven't found them! where could they be? artoo frantically beeps something to see-threepio. threepio use the comlink? oh, my! i forgot i turned it off! int. death star - garbage room meanwhile, luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt. int. death star - main forward bay - service panel muffled sounds of luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly. threepio are you there, sir? int. death star - garbage room luke threepio! int. death star - main forward bay - service panel threepio we've had some problems... luke (over comlink) will you shut up and listen to me? shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? do you copy? int. death star - garbage room luke shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. int. death star - main forward bay - service panel luke (over comlink) shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. threepio (to artoo) no. shut them all down! hurry! threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from luke's comlink. threepio listen to them! they're dying, artoo! curse my metal body! i wasn't fast enough. it's all my fault! my poor master! luke (over comlink) threepio, we're all right! int. death star - garbage room the screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. the walls have stopped moving. han, chewie and leia embrace in the background. luke we're all right. you did great. luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number. luke hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? int. death star - main forward bay - service panel han (over comlink) three-two-six-eight-two-seven. int. death star - tractor beam - power generator trench ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. the trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. the clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. the old jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables. he carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue. int. death star - unused hallway the group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. han and luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts. han if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from solo. luke well, let's get moving! chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling. han (to chewie) where are you going? the dia nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. han aims his pistol. leia no, wait. they'll hear! han fires at the doorway. the noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. luke simply shakes his head in disgust. han (to chewie) come here, you big coward! chewie shakes his head "no." han chewie! come here! leia listen. i don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as i tell you. okay? han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl. han look, your worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! i take orders from one person! me! leia it's a wonder you're still alive. (looking at chewie) will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? han watches her start away. he looks at luke. han no reward is worth this. they follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor. int. death star - power trench suddenly a door behind ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench. ben instantly slips into the shadows as an officer moves to within a few feet of him. officer secure this area until the alert is canceled. first trooper give me regular reports. all but two of the stormtroopers leave. first trooper do you know what's going on? second trooper maybe it's another drill. ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. with the help of the force, ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway. second trooper what was that? first trooper oh, it's nothing. don't worry about it. int. death star - hallway luke, han, chewbacca, and leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. troopers are milling about the ship. luke takes out his pocket comlink. han (looking at his ship) there she is. luke see-threepio, do you copy? threepio (voice) for the moment. uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. luke we're right above you. stand by. han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. leia moves towards han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship. leia you came in that thing? you're braver that i thought. han nice! come on! han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. they round a corner and run right into twenty imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks. first trooper it's them! blast them! before even thinking, han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. his blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor. han (to luke and leia) get back to the ship! luke where are you going? come back! han has already rounded a corner and does not hear. leia he certainly has courage. luke what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? come on! luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. luke and leia start off toward the starship hangar. int. death star - subhallway han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. he is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. the troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. the troops begin to raise their laser guns. soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. solo jumps backward as they fire at him. int. death star - subhallway chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. around the corner shoots han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also. int. death star - subhallway luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. they quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. int. death star - central core shaft luke and leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. the bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and luke almost rushes into the abyss. he loses his balance off the end of the bridge as leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back. luke (gasping) i think we took a wrong turn. blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. luke fires back at the advancing troops. leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door. leia there's no lock! luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol. luke that oughta hold it for a while. leia quick, we've got to get across. find the control that extends the bridge. luke oh, i think i just blasted it. luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds. leia they're coming through! luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. they exchange fire. two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. a trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest. another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. troopers move back off the bridge; luke hands the gun to leia. luke here, hold this. luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. it has a grappler hook on it. a trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at luke and leia. as luke works with the rope, leia returns the laser volley. another trooper appears and fires at them, as leia returns his fire as well. suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops. leia here they come! leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. he tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. leia looks at luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. luke is very surprised. leia for luck! luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. just as luke and leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway. int. death star - narrow passageway ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. he checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. darth vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old jedi. int. death star - main forward bay threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp. threepio where could they be? artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response. int. death star - corridor - blast shields door han and chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail. trooper close the blast doors! at the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. the young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut. trooper open the blast doors! open the blast doors! int. death star - hallway leading to main forward bay ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. just before he reaches the hangar, darth vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. vader lights his saber. ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward. vader i've been waiting for you, obi-wan. we meet again, at last. the circle is now complete. ben kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. the fearsome dark knight takes a defensive stance. vader when i left you, i was but the learner; now i am the master. ben only a master of evil, darth. the two galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. he shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of the sith. a masterful slash stroke by vader is blocked by the old jedi. another of the jedi's blows is blocked, then countered. ben moves around the dark lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. the two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound. vader your powers are weak, old man. ben you can't win, darth. if you strike me down, i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. their lightsabers continue to meet in combat. int. death star - main forward bay han solo and chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar. han didn't we just leave this party? chewbacca growls a reply, as luke and the princess join them. han what kept you? leia we ran into some old friends. luke is the ship all right? han seems okay, if we can get to it. just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. int. death star - hallway vader and ben kenobi continue their powerful duel. as they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. troopers look on in interest as the old jedi and dark lord of the sith fight. suddenly luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point. luke look! luke, leia, han, and chewie look up and see ben and vader emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay. int. death star - docking bay threepio and artoo-detoo are in the center of the death star's imperial docking bay. threepio come on, artoo, we're going! threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards ben and the sith knight. he pulls on artoo. int. death star - hallway solo, chewie, luke, and leia tensely watch the duel. the troops rush toward the battling knights. han now's our chance! go! they start for the millennium falcon. ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. vader takes advantage of ben's momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around. the old jedi knight looks over his shoulder at luke, lifts his sword from vader's then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face. vader brings his sword down, cutting old ben in half. ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but ben is not in it. vader is puzzled at ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. as the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship. luke sees ben cut in two and starts for him. aghast, he yells out. luke no! the stormtroopers turn toward luke and begin firing at him. the robots are already moving up the ramp into the millennium falcon, while luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. solo joins in the laserfire. vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down. han (to luke) come on! leia come on! luke, its too late! han blast the door! kid! luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes. the door begins to slide shut. three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them, shutting vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. a stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. luke starts for the advancing troops, as solo and leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. he fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor. ben's voice run, luke! run! luke looks around to see where the voice came from. he turns toward the pirateship, ducking imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. the dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship as chewie adjusts his controls. han i hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. okay, hit it! chewbacca growls in agreement. ext. millennium falcon the millennium falcon powers away from the death star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space. int. millennium falcon - central hold area luke, saddened by the loss of obi-wan kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on. leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and luke turns and looks up at her. she sits down beside him. int. millennium falcon - cockpit solo spots approaching enemy ships. han (to chewie) we're coming up on the sentry ships. hold 'em off! angle the deflector shields while i charge up the main guns! int. millennium falcon - central hold area luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him. luke i can't believe he's gone. artoo-detoo beeps a reply. leia there wasn't anything you could have done. han rushes into the hold area where luke is sitting with the princess. han (to luke) come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! int. millennium falcon - gunports - cockpit solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport. int. millennium falcon - hold area luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as leia heads for the cockpit. int. millennium falcon - gunports - cockpit luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship. int. millennium falcon - solo's gunport han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone. han (to luke) you in, kid? okay, stay sharp! int. millennium falcon - gunports - cockpit chewbacca and princess leia search the heavens for attacking tie fighters. the wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly. int. millennium falcon - solo's gunport - cockpit computer graphic readouts form on solo's target screen, as han reaches for controls. int. millennium falcon - gunport - cockpit luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser cannon's control button. int. millennium falcon - cockpit. chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks. leia (into intercom) here they come! int. millennium falcon - cockpit - pov (point of view) - space the imperial tie fighters move towards the millennium falcon, one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship. int. tie fighter - cockpit the stars whip past behind the imperial pilot as he adjusts his maneuvering joy stick. ext. millennium falcon - in space the tie fighter races past the falcon, firing laser beams as it passes. int. millennium falcon - hold area threepio is seated in the hold area, next to artoo-detoo. the pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the room and then comes back on. int. millennium falcon - cockpit - gunports a tie fighter maneuvers in front of han, who follows it and fires at it with the laser cannon. luke does likewise, as the fighter streaks into view. the ship has suffered a minor hit, and bounces slightly. ext. space two tie fighters dive down toward the pirateship. int. millennium falcon - gunports luke fires at an unseen fighter. luke they're coming in too fast! ext. space - millennium falcon/tie fighters pan with pirateship as two tie fighters charge through the background. laserbolts streak from all the craft. int. millennium falcon - chewbacca the ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit. the wookiee chatters something to leia. ext. tie fighter - space full shot of a tie fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship. ext. space - tie fighters the two tie fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the pirateship. int. millennium falcon - main passageway a laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. the ship lurches violently, throwing poor threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips. threepio oooh! int. millennium falcon - cockpit - gunports leia watches the computer readout as chewbacca manipulates the ship's controls. leia we've lost lateral controls. han don't worry, she'll hold together. an enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks. han (to ship) you hear me, baby? hold together! artoo-detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while. int. millennium falcon - gunport luke swivels in his gun mount, following the tie fighter with his laser cannon. int. millennium falcon - gunport solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter. ext. space a tie fighter streaks in front of the starship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit leia watches the tie fighter ship fly over. ext. space a tie fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms overhead. int. millennium falcon - gunports luke follows the tie fighter across his field of view, firing laserbeams from his cannon. ext. tie fighter a tie fighter dives past the pirateship. int. millennium falcon - gunports luke fires at a tie fighter. at his port, han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. he connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. han laughs victoriously. ext. space two tie fighters move toward and over the millennium falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship. int. millennium falcon - gunports another tie fighter moves in on the pirateship and luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit. luke got him! i got him! han turns and gives luke a victory wave which luke gleefully returns. han great kid! don't get cocky. han turns back to his laser cannon. ext. space two more tie fighters cross in front of the pirateship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit while chewbacca manipulates the controls, leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports. leia there are still two more of them out there! ext. space a tie fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it. int. millennium falcon - gunports luke and han look into their respective projected target screens. an imperial fighter crosses solo's port, and han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon. another fighter crosses luke's port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face. ext. space the tie fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it. int. millennium falcon - gunports luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit. the pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire. ext. space - tie fighter the last of the attacking imperial tie fighters looms in, firing upon the falcon. int. millennium falcon - gunport solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of the tie fighter. the fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from solo's laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments. luke (laughing) that's it! we did it! the princess jumps up and gives chewie a congratulatory hug. leia we did it! int. millennium falcon - passageway threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires. threepio help! i think i'm melting!

(looking pointedly to han) it's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. you must use the information in this r2 unit to plan the attack. it is our only hope. ext. space the surface of the death star ominously approaches the red planet yavin. int. death star - control room grand moff tarkin and lord vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. tarkin moves to answer the call. tarkin yes. death star intercom voice we are approaching the planet yavin. the rebel base is on a moon on the far side. we are preparing to orbit the planet. ext. yavin - jungle a lone guard stands in a tower high above the yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. a mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green. int. massassi - war room briefing area dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. the low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of r2-type robots. everyone is listening intently to what dodonna is saying. han and chewbacca are standing near the back. dodonna the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. it's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault. a small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. gold leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses dodonna. gold leader pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? dodonna well, the empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. artoo-detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left. dodonna the approach will not be easy. you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. the target area is only two meters wide. it's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. the shaft leads directly to the reactor system. a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. a murmer of disbelief runs through the room. dodonna only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. the shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. luke is sitting next to wedge antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old. wedge that's impossible, even for a computer. luke it's not impossible. i used to bull's- eye womp rats in my t-sixteen back home. they're not much bigger than two meters. dodonna man your ships! and may the force be with you! the group rises and begins to leave. ext. space the death star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon. int. death star tarkin and vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to yavin and the forth moon. death star intercom voice orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. vader this will be a day long remembered. it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion. int. massassi outpost - main hangar deck luke, threepio and little artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. in an area isolated from this activity luke finds han and chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder. man's voice (over loudspeaker) all flight trooper, man your stations. all flight troops, man your stations. han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation. luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure. luke so... you got your reward and you're just leaving then? han that's right, yeah! i got some old debts i've got to pay off with this stuff. even if i didn't, you don't think i'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? why don't you come with us? you're pretty good in a fight. i could use you. luke (getting angry) come on! why don't you take a look around? you know what's about to happen, what they're up against. they could use a good pilot like you. you're turning your back on them. han what good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. it's more like suicide. luke all right. well, take care of yourself, han. i guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? luke goes off and han hesitates, then calls to him. han hey, luke... may the force be with you! luke turns and sees han wink at him. luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off. han turns to chewie who growls at his captain, han what're you lookin' at? i know what i'm doing. int. main hangar deck - luke's ship luke, leia, and dodonna meet under a huge space fighter. leia what's wrong? luke oh, it's han! i don't know, i really thought he'd change his mind. leia he's got to follow his own path. no one can choose it for him. luke i only wish ben were here. leia gives luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. as luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm. biggs luke! i don't believe it! how'd you get here... are you going out with us?! luke biggs! of course, i'll be up there with you! listen, have i got some stories to tell... red leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind luke and biggs. he has the confident smile of a born leader. red leader are you... luke skywalker? have you been checked out on the incom t-sixty- five? biggs sir, luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories. red leader pats luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter. red leader i met your father once when i was just a boy, he was a great pilot. you'll do all right. if you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right. luke thank you, sir. i'll try. red leader hurries to his own ship. biggs i've got to get aboard. listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. all right? luke i told you i'd make it someday, biggs. biggs (going off) you did, all right. it's going to be like old times, luke. we're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped! luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. he heads for his ship. as luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter. chief this r2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. do you want a new one? luke not on your life! that little droid and i have been through a lot together. (to artoo) you okay, artoo? the crewmen lower artoo-detoo into the craft. now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine. luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into luke's x-wing. it's an emotional-filled moment as artoo beeps good-bye. chief okay, easy she goes! threepio hang on tight,artoo, you've got to come back. artoo beeps in agreement. threepio you wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? artoo whistles his reply. all final preparations are made for the approaching battle. the hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. the hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. a signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles. ben's voice luke, the force will be with you. luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones. ext. massassi outpost - jungle all that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. the muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud cover. int. massassi outpost - war room the princess, threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet yavin and its four moons. the red dot that represents the death star moves ever closer to the system. a series of green dots appear around the fourth moon. a din of indistinct chatter fills the war room. massassi intercom voice stand-by alert. death star approaching. estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes. ext. space the death star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface of yavin in the foreground, as many x-wing fighters flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame. ext. space - another angle light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow around a huge planet, yavin. rebel fighters flying in formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly pull away. int. red leader starship - cockpit red leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, looking to each side at his wing men. red leader all wings report in. int. another cockpit one of the rebel fighters checks in through his mike. red ten red ten standing by. int. biggs' cockpit biggs checks his fighter's controls, alert and ready for combat. red seven (over biggs' headset) red seven standing by. biggs red three standing by. int. porkins' cockpit porkins red six standing by. red nine (over headset) red nine standing by. int. wedge's fighter - cockpit wedge red two standing by. int. luke's x-wing fighter - cockpit red eleven (over headset) red eleven standing by. luke red five standing by. ext. luke's x-wing fighter artoo-detoo, in position outside of the fighter, turns his head from side to side and makes beeping sounds. int. red leader's fighter - cockpit red leader lock s-foils in attack position. ext. space the group of x-wing fighters move in formation toward the death star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "x" position. int. biggs' cockpit read leader (over headset) we're passing through their magnetic field. int. red leader's cockpit red leader hold tight!

(she doesn't respond) m'lady, please! she turns. they walk away. artoo lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them. ext. senate building - day the massive senate building glistens in the afternoon sun. small patches of fog have still to burn off. int. senate chamber - day the vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. mas amedda, the supreme chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as palpatine confers with an aide, uv gizen, riding a small one man floating scooter. mas amedda order! we shall have order! the motion for the republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time. everything quiets down. the aide disperses, and supreme chancellor palpatine steps to the podium. palpatine ...my esteemed colleagues, excuse me... i have just received some tragic and disturbing news. senator amidala of the naboo system... has been assassinated! there is a shock silence in the vast arena. palpatine (continued) this grievous blow is especially personal to me. before i became chancellor, i served amidala when she was queen. she was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. she was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. she believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. her death is a great loss to us all. we will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend. there is a moment of silence. ask aak, the senator of malastare, moves his pod into the centre of the arena. senator ask aak how many more senators will die before this civil strife ends! we must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it. a second pod moves into the centre of the area with darsana, the ambassador of glee anselm. ambassador darsana why weren't the jedi able to stop this assassination? we are no longer safe, under their protection. senator orn free taa swings forward in his pod. orn free taa the republic needs more security now! before it comes to war. palpatine must i remind the senator from malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. peace is our objective here... not war. the senators yell pro and con. mas amedda tries to calm things down. senator padme amidala, with captain typho, jar jar, and dorme, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena. amidala my noble colleagues, i concur with the supreme chancellor. at all costs, we do not want war! the senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and applause. palpatine it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the senator from naboo, padm� amidala. padm� less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. one of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. i was the target but, more importantly, i believe this security measure before you, was the target. i have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage... many of the senators boo and yell at senator amidala. padm� (continuing) i warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. i have experienced the misery of war first-hand; i do not wish to do it again. there is sporadic yelling for and against her statements. padm� wake up, senators... you must wake up! if you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! many will lose their lives. all will lose their freedom. this decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great republic. i pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! does anyone here want that? i cannot believe they do. there is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. senator orn free taa moves his pod next to amidala. orn free taa my motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. that is the rule of law. amidala looks angry and frustrated. palpatine gives her a sympathetic look. palpatine due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. until then, the senate stands adjourned. ext. executive quarters building - day the giant towers of the republic executive building seem to reach the heavens. traffic clogs the smoggy sky. int. chancellor's office - day chancellor palpatine sits behind his desk with two red-clad royal guards on either side of the door. yoda, plot koon, ki-ad-mundi, and mace windu sit acress from him. palpatine i don't know how much longer i can hold off the vote, my friends. more and more star systems are joining the separatists. mace windu if they do break away - palpatine no! i will not let that happen! mace windu but if they do, you must realise there aren't enough jedi to protect the republic. we are keepers of the peace, not soldiers. palpatine master yoda, do you think it will really come to war? yoda closes his eyes. yoda worse than war, i fear... much worse. palpatine what? mace windu what do you sense, master? yoda impossible to see ... the dark side clouds everything. but this i am sure of - (opens his eyes) do their duty the jedi will. a muted buzzer sounds. a hologram of an aide, dar wac, appears on the chancellor's desk. dar wac the loyalist committee has arrived, my lord. palpatine send them in. they all stand as senator amidala, captain typho, jar jar, mas amedda, dorme, and senators bail organa, horox ryyder and orn free taa enter the office. yoda and mace windu move to greet the senator, yoda taps amidala with his cane. yoda with you the force is strong... young senator. to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart. padm� thank you, master yoda. do you have any idea who was behind the attack? mace windu our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of naboo. padm� i don't wish to disagree but i think that count dooku was behind it. there is a stir of surprise. mace windu you know, m'lady, count dooku was once a jedi. he wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character. ki-adi-mundi he is a political idealist, not a murderer. yoda in dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains senator, in grave danger you are. palpatine gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city. palpatine count dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. it appears he has no desire to start a war. why would he kill you? to what end? padm� i don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it... after gazing out of the window for several moments palpatine turns to mace. palpatine master jedi, may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces. bail organa do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times? padm� chancellor, if i may comment, i do not believe the... palpatine ..."situation is that serious." no, but i do, senator. padm� chancellor, please! i don't want any more guards! palpatine i realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... master kenobi... palpatine nods to mace windu, who nods back. mace windu that's possible. he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion. palpatine you must remember him, m'lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict. padm� this is not necessary, chancellor. palpatine do it for me, m'lady, please. i will rest easier. we had a big scare today. the thought of losing you is unbearable. amidala sighs as the jedi get up to leave. mace windu i will have obi-wan report to you immediately, m'lady. yoda leans into her ear. yoda too little about yourself you worry, senator, and too much about politics. be mindful of your danger, padm�. accept our help. as the jedi leave the office, palpatine continues to pace behind his desk. palpatine i will not like this republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two ext. senate apartments - twilight a graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of coruscant. int. senate building, apartment corridor - evening the door to the apartment slides open. jar jar walks into the corridor, where two jedi are exiting the elevator. he recognises obi-wan and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand. jar jar obi! obi! obi! mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. wahoooooo! obi-wan smiles. obi-wan it's good to see you, too, jar jar. jar jar oops! wheresa mesa manners? excuse me, master obi-wan. i completely forgot myself for a moment there. i have had to learn diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. don't really see the point, actually, but members of the senate seem to prefer it... jar jar notices obi-wan's apprentice. jar jar (continuing) ...and this, i take it, is your apprentice... nooooooooo! annie? noooooooo! little bitty annie? (looks at anakin) nooooooo! yousa so biggen! yiyiyiyyi! annie!! mesa no believen. anakin hi, jar jar. jar jar grabs hold of anakin and envelops him in a big hug. jar jar annie! annie! yiyiyiyiyiyiiii! int. senate building, apartment - evening padme is in a conference with captain typho and dorme. jar jar enters the room, followed by the two jedi. jar jar lookie... lookie... oops!... oh, dear, i'm afraid i've forgotten myself again. padme and typho rise as obi-wan and anakin stop before the senator. obi-wan steps forward. anakin stares at padme. she glances at him. obi-wan it's a great pleasure to see you again, m'lady. padm� it has been far too long master kenobi. i'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but i must warn you that i think your presence here is unnecessary. obi-wan i'm sure the jedi council have their reasons. she moves in front of anakin padm� annie?? (stares) my goodness you've grown. they look at each other for a long moment. anakin (trying to be smooth) so have you... grown more beautiful, i mean... and much shorter... for a senator, i mean. obi-wan looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. padme laughs and shakes her head. padm� oh annie, you'll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine. this embarrasses anakin, and he looks down. obi-wan and captain typho smile. obi-wan our presence will be invisible, m'lady. captain typho i am very grateful you are here, master kenobi. the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit. padm� i don't need more security, i need answers. i want to know who is trying to kill me. obi-wan (frowning) we're here to protect you senator, not to start an investigation. anakin we will find out who is trying to kill you padm�, i promise you. he's done it again. he bites his lip in frustration and shame. obi-wan gives anakin a dirty look. obi-wan we are not going to exceed our mandate, my young padawan learner. anakin i meant in the interest of protecting her, master, of course. obi-wan we are not going through this exercise again, anakin. you will pay attention to my lead. anakin why? obi-wan what??!! anakin why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? protection is a job for local security... not jedi. it's overkill, master. investigation is implied in our mandate. obi-wan we will do as the council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one. padm� perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. now if you will excuse me i will retire. everyone gives amidala a slight bow as she and dorme leave the room. captain typho well, i know i feel a lot better having you here. i'll have an officer on every floor and i'll be at the command centre downstairs. jar jar mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, annie. deesa bad times, bombad times. captain typho leaves. anakin she didn't even recognise me, jar jar. i thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely. jar jar shesa happy. happier den mesa see-en her in longo time. obi-wan anakin, you're focusing on the negative again. be mindful of your thoughts. she was glad to see us. now lets check the security here. anakin yes, my master. ext. jedi temple - evening the vast jedi temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky. int. jedi temple, corridor - evening mace windu and yoda walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end. mace windu why couldn't we see this attack on the senator? yoda masking the future, is this disturbance in the force. mace windu the propecy is coming true, the dark side is growing. yoda and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future. only going through the dark side can we see. mace windu it's been ten years, and the sith still have no shown themselves. do you think they are behind this? yoda ...out there, they are. a certainty that is. mace windu do you think obi-wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force? yoda only if he chooses to follow his destiny. there is a long silence as they walk away. only footsteps are heard. int. senate building, amidala's apartment, bedroom - night padme is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. artoo stands in the corner of the bedroom. his power is off. int. senate building, amidala's apartment, main r0om - night anakin is standing in the living room. he is in a meditative state. it is quiet. we hear distant footsteps in the corridor outside the apartment. suddenly anakin's eyes pop open. his eyes dart around the room. he reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt. the door to the apartment slides open, and obi-wan enters. obi-wan captain typho has more than enough men downstairs. no assassin will try that way. any activity up here? anakin quiet as a tomb. i don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. obi-wan checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. it shows a shot of artoo by the door, but no sign of padme on the bed. obi-wan what's going on? anakin shrugs. anakin she covered that camera. i don't think she liked me watching her. obi-wan what is she thinking? anakin she programmed artoo to warn us if there's an intruder. obi-wan it's not an intruder i'm worried about. there are many other ways to kill a senator. anakin i know, but we also want to catch this assassin. don't we, master? obi-wan you're using her as bait?? anakin it was her idea... no harm will come to her. i can sense everything going on in that room. trust me. obi-wan it's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice. anakin and yours are? obi-wan possibly. int. senate building, amidala's apartment, bedroom - night as padme sleeps, a probe droid approaches outside her window. it sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. a faint sound is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window. artoo wakes up, and his lights go on. the probe droid freezes. artoo looks around, makes a plaintive little sound, then shuts down again. the probe droid attaches a little tube to the window. two deadly looking centipede-like kouhuns exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping padme. int. senate building, amidala's apartment, main room - night anakin and obi-wan continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment. obi-wan you look tired. anakin i don't sleep well, anymore. obi-wan because of your mother? anakin i don't know why i keep dreaming about her now. i haven't seen her since i was little. obi-wan dreams pass in time. anakin i'd rather dream of padm�. just being around her again is... intoxicating. obi-wan mind your thoughts, anakin, they betray you. you've made a commitment to the jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. they're not to be trusted. anakin she's not like the others in the senate, master. obi-wan it's been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds. anakin not another lecture, master. not on the economics of politics.... it's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. the chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt. obi-wan palpatine's a politician, i've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the senators. anakin i think he is a good man. my instincts are very positive about... anakin looks stunned. he looks sharply at obi-wan obi-wan i sense it, too. int. senate building, amidala's apartment, bedroom - night artoo sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. the kouhuns are inches from padme's face. their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out. obi-wan and anakin burst into the room. the kouhuns stand on their hind legs and hiss as padme wakes up. anakin throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber. obi-wan sees the droid outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window. ext. window ledge, apartment building - night obi-wan flies through the glass window and flings himself at the probe droid, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. the probe droid sinks under the weight of obi-wan but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city. int. senate building, amidala's apartment - night anakin and padme stare at the sight of obi-wan being carried off by the droid. anakin turns to her. she pulls her nightdress around her shoulders. anakin stay here! captain typho, with two guards and dorme, enter the room as anakin dashes out. ext. cityscape, coruscant - night the probe droid sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing obi-wan to almost lose his grip. as they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, obi-wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid. its power shuts off! obi-wan and the droid drop like rocks. obi-wan realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. the droid's systems light up again and it takes off. ext. senate apartments - entrance - night anakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. he vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above. ext. cityscape, coruscant - night the droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the jedi loose. it moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. it takesthe jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as obi-wan is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the droid. the droid heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. when the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called zam wesell, sees the droid approach with obi-wan hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the jedi. explosions burst all around obi-wan. obi-wan i have a bad feeling about this. finally, the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up. obi-wan falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. the jedi struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, anakin. anakin that was wacky! i almost lost you in the traffic. obi-wan what took you so long? anakin oh, you know, master, i couldn't find a speeder i really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know i had to get a really gonzo color... they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol. obi-wan if you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young padawan, you would rival master yoda as a swordsman. anakin i thought i already did. obi-wan only in your mind, my very young apprentice. careful!! hey, easy!! as this conversation is going on, anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. zam wesell continues firing at them. anakin sorry, i forgot you don't like flying, master. obi-wan i don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide! they barely miss a commuter train anakin master, you know i've been flying since before i could walk. i'm very good at this. obi-wan just slow down! zam wessel and the jedi race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. the speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. zam races into a tram tunnel. obi-wan (continuing) wait! don't go in there! anakin zooms into the tunnel after zam. they see a tram coming at them. they brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport. obi-wan (continuing) you know i don't like it when you do that! anakin sorry, master. don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now! zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the jedi off. oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid zam and the jedi. zam does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the jedi. she is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. to avoid being hit by the laser bolts, anakin slams on the brakes and moves alongside zam. she now fires point-blank at obi-wan. obi-wan what are you doing? he's gonna blast me! anakin right - this isn't working. anakin slides underneath zam's speeder. they race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. the bounty hunter skims over the rooftops, causing anakin to drop behind. anakin goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. they race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. a large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. they round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops. obi-wan that was too close! anakin clear that! obi-wan what?? anakin clear the flag! we're losing power! hurry! obi-wan leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. the speeder lurches forward with a surge of power. obi-wan whooooaaa! don't do that! i don't like it when you do that! anakin so sorry, master. they chase the bounty hunter through a power refinery. obi-wan it's dangerous near those power couplings! slow down! don't go through there! huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. obi-wan (continuing) yiiii, what are you doing? anakin sorry, master! obi-wan (sarcastically) oh, that was good... anakin that was crazy!!! zam slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as anakin approaches. anakin (continuing) ahh, damn. obi-wan stop!! anakin no, we can make it. anakin barely misses the bounty hunter's speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. a giant gasball shoots up, causing anakin to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder. obi-wan i'm crazy... i'm crazy... i'm crazy. anakin but it worked... we made it. obi-wan (angrily) it didn't work... we've stalled! and you almost got us killed! anakin i think we're still alive. anakin works to get the speeder started. it quickly races to life. obi-wan (very angrily) it was stupid! anakin (sheepishly) i could have made it... obi-wan (furious) but you didn't!!! and now we've lost him. suddenly, there is an ambush. laser bolts fire everywhere. explosions surround them. they look up to see zam wessel take off. anakin no we didn�t... out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear after zam. they are smoking. obi-wan slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. zam goes up and down, through cross-traffic. there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. zam turns down and left between two buildings. anakin pulls up and to the right obi-wan where are you going?! he went down there, the other way. anakin this is a shortcut... i think. obi-wan what do you mean, �you think?� what kind of shortcut?! he went completely the other way! you�ve lost him! anakin master, if we keep this chase going, that creep�s gonna end up deep fried. personally, i�d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he�s working for... obi-wan (sarcastic) oh, so that�s why we�re going in the wrong direction. anakin turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up. obi-wan (continuing) well, you lost him. anakin i�m deeply sorry, master. anakin looks around front and back. he spots something. he seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach. anakin (continuing) excuse me for a moment. anakin jumps out of the speeder. obi-wan looks down and sees zam�s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunter�s speeder. the speeder wobbles under the impact. zam looks up and realises what has happened. zam takes off, and anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. anakin works his way back to the speeder�s cockpit, just as zam stops suddenly, and anakin flies forward to the left front fork. zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. there is a blast near anakin's hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where zam can�t reach him. he scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. obi-wan has jumped into the driver�s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. the two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. finally, anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless jedi, knocking the sword out of his hand. obi-wan races under the speeder and catches the jedi weapon in the passenger�s seat. anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the force, pulls the gun out of zam�s hand. she grabs the jedi�s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. it goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. the speeder careens wildly out of control. zam struggles to pull the speeder out of it�s nose dive. obi-wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunter�s speeder. just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, zam pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. anakin goes flying into the street. ext. entertainment street - night zam exits the crashed speeder and runs. anakin picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street. it's the seedy underbelly of the city. broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. it's pretty crowded with various alien low-lifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upperclass slummers. anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing zam. he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. the young jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. ahead, zam turns in through a door and disappears. a nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. anakin is just about to follow zam when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. people start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. obi-wan gets out and walks over, holding out anakin's lightsaber. obi-wan anakin! anakin she went into that club, master. obi-wan patience. obi-wan hands anakin the lightsaber. obi-wan (continuing) here. next time try not to lose it. anakin sorry, master. anakin reaches for the lightsaber, but obi-wan holds it back. obi-wan a jedi's saber is his most precious possession. anakin yes, master. he reaches for the lightsaber, obi-wan pulls it back. obi-wan he must keep it with him at all times. anakin i know, master. obi-wan this weapon is your life! anakin i've heard this lesson before... obi-wan finally holds out the lightsaber and anakin grabs it. obi-wan but, you haven't learned anything, anakin. anakin i try, master. int. nightclub - night obi-wan and anakin enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them obi-wan why do i think you are going to be the death of me?! anakin don't say that master... you're the closest thing i have to a father... i love you. i don't want to cause you pain. obi-wan then why don't you listen to me?! anakin i will. i'll do better, i promise. obi-wan do you see him him? anakin i think he's a she... obi-wan then be extra careful... (nods to a room) check it out. obi-wan goes away. anakin where are you going, master? obi-wan to get a drink. obi-wan heads for the bar. anakin blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where alien faces look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. obi-wan arrives at the bar. he signals the barman. close - somewhere in the room a hand moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. at the bar, a glass is placed in from of obi-wan. a drink is poured. he lifts the glass. elan sleazebaggano wanna buy some death sticks? obi-wan looks at him. he moves his fingers slightly. obi-wan you don't want to sell me death- sticks. elan i don't want to sell you death- sticks. obi-wan moves his fingers. obi-wan you want to go home and rethink your life. elan i want to go home and rethink my life. he leaves. obi-wan lifts the drink and tosses it back. close. the gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. the bounty hunter starts to move toward the bar. anakin checks out alien faces. obi-wan signals for another drink. the gun moves toward his unsuspecting back. the drink is poured. obi-wan reaches for it. the gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly obi-wan turns fast. his lightsaber flashes. there is a shrill scream and zam's arm hits the floor. the gun drops from its twitching fingers. blood spreads. the room is silent. aliens rise menacingly from their seats, and anakin is suddenly at obi-wan's side, his lightsaber glowing. anakin easy... official business. go back to your drinks. slowly, the aliens sit. conversation resumes. onstage, the performers pick up their routine. obi-wan and anakin lift zam and carry her out. ext. alley outside nightclub - night obi-wan and anakin carry zam into the alley and lower her to the ground. obi-wan attends to her wounded shoulder. she stares up hatefully at anakin. she winces in pain, then nods. obi-wan do you know who it was you were trying to kill? zam wessel the senator from naboo. obi-wan who hired you? zam glares at obi-wan. zam wessel it was just a job. anakin tell us! zam wessel that senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake i did... obi-wan this wound's going to need treatment. anakin who hired you? tell us... tell us now! zam glares hatefully. zam it was a bounty hunter called... there is a sudden ftzzz sound. zam twitches. she blinks in surprise and dies. there is a weoosh from above. obi-wan and anakin look up yo see an armoured rocket-man taking off from a roof high above. obi-wan looks down at zam. he touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart. obi-wan toxic dart... int. senate building, amidala's apartment - day anakin and jar jar stand near the door of the anteroom to padme's bedroom. padme and dorme move about packing luggage. padm� representative binks. i know i can count on you. jar jar yousa betchen mesa bottums. padm� what?! jar jar (coughs, recovers) oh, pardone-ay, senator. i mean, i am honoured to accept this heavy burden. i take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. (pompously) it is not every day that i am called upon to... padme kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. jar jar turns red. padm� you're a good friend, jar jar. i don't wish to hold you up. i'm sure you have a great deal to do. jar jar of course, m'lady. jar jar bows and goes out. as he passes anakin, he flashes a dazzling smile... padme is in a very bad mood. padm� i do not like this idea of hiding. anakin don't worry. now that the council has ordered an investigation, it won't take master obi-wan long to find that bounty hunter. padm� (frustrated) i haven't worked for a year to defeat the "military creation act" not to be here when its fate is decided. anakin sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us. padm� pride?!? annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time. anakin sorry, m'lady. i was only trying to... padm� annie! no! anakin please don't call me that. padm� what? anakin annie... padm� i've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it? anakin it's anakin. when you say annie it's like i'm still a little boy... and i'm not. padm� i'm sorry, anakin. it's impossible to deny you've... (looks him over) ...that you've grown up. padme smiles at anakin. he becomes a little shy. anakin master obi-wan manages not to see it... padm� mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. it's the only way we grow. anakin don't get me wrong... obi-wan is a great mentor. as wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu. i am truly thankful to be his apprentice. only... although i'm a padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... i'm ahead of him. i'm ready for the trials. i know i am! he knows it too. he believes i'm too unpredictable... other jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... i know i started my training late... but he won't let me move on. padm� that must be frustrating. anakin it's worse... he's overly critical. he never listens! he just doesn't understand! it's not fair! padme cannot surpress a laugh. she shakes her head. padm� i'm sorry... you sounded exactly like that little boy i once knew, when he didn't get his way. anakin i'm not whining! i'm not. padme just smiles at him. dorme laughs in the background. padm� i didn't say it to hurt you. anakin i know... there is a brief silence. padme comes over to anakin. padme anakin... they look into each other's eyes for the first time. padm� (continuing) don't try to grow up too fast. anakin i am grown up. you said it yourself. anakin looks deep into padme's eyes. padm� please don't look at me like that. anakin why not? padm� because i can see what you're thinking. anakin (laughing) ahh... so, you have jedi powers too? dorme is watching with concern. padm� it makes me feel uncomfortable. anakin sorry, m'lady. anakin backs away as padme turns and goes back to her packing. ext. coruscant, spaceport freighter docks, transport bus - day a small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of coruscant's industrial area. the spaceport is bustling with activity. transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. the bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. it parks in the shadows of an overhang. int. coruscant, spaceport freighter docks, transport bus - day anakin and padme, dressed in outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where captain typho, dorme and obi-wan are waiting to hand them their luggage. dorme is dressed to look like senator amidala. captain typho be safe, m'lady. padm� thank you, captain. take good care of dorme... the threat's on you two now. dorme he'll be safe with me. they laugh, and padme embraces her faithful handmaiden. dorme start to weep. padm� you'll be fine. dorme it's not me, m'lady. i worry about you. what if they realise i'm not you? padm� (looks to anakin) then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is. dorme and padme smile. anakin frowns as obi-wan pulls him aside. obi-wan anakin, you stay put on naboo. do not attract any attention. do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the council. anakin yes, master. obi-wan (to padme) i will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, m'lady. you'll be back here in no time. padm� i will be most grateful for your speed, master jedi. anakin time to go. padm� i know. padme gives dorme a last hug. anakin picks up the luggage, and the two peasants exit the speeder bus, where artoo is waiting for them. obi-wan may the force be with you. anakin may the force be with you, master. they head off toward the giant starfreighter. padm� suddenly, i'm afraid... anakin i'm kinda scared too. this is my first assignment on my own. padm� there's nothing to worry about... we have artoo with us. the two laugh. obi-wan and captain typho watch anakin and padme disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with artoo trundling along behind them. obi-wan i hope he doesn't try anything foolish. captain typho i'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him. ext. freighter docks - coruscant - day the freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of coruscant. it soon moves into the crowded skies. int. jedi temple, main hallway - late day from high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. obi-wan crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the analysis rooms. int. jedi temple, analysis cubicles - late day obi-wan walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. he comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. a pk-4 analysis droid comes to life. a tray slides out of the console. pk-4 place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray, please. obi-wan puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. the droid activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of obi-wan. obi-wan it's a toxic dart. i need to know where it came from and who made it. pk-4 one moment, please. diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. obi-wan watches as the screen goes blank. they tray slides out. pk-4 (continuing) as you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. markings cannot be identified. probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society. obi-wan excuse me? could you try again please? pk-4 master jedi, our records are very thorough. they cover eight percent of the galaxy. if i can't tell you where it came from, nobody can. obi-wan picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the droid. obi-wan thanks for your assistance! you may not be able to figure this out, but i think i know someone who might. ext. space, starship freighter the massive, slow-moving freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed. int. starfreighter, storage hold - day the great, gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their belongings. to one side artoo is coming to the head of a food line, where servers are ladling out bowls of mush. artoo holds two bowls. server keep moving! keep moving! artoo slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. with one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. a server sees him. food server (continuing) hey! no droids! artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. the server shouts after him angrily. the little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes to where anakin is sound asleep. the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare. he is very restless. anakin no, no, mom, no... he is sweating. padme leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. he wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. padme simply looks at him. he stares back, somewhat confused. artoo fills up two bowls with mush. anakin (continuing) what? padm� you seemed to be having a nightmare. anakin looks at padme a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. she hands him a bowl of mush and bread. padm� (continuing) are you hungry? anakin thank you. padm� we went into lightspeed a while ago. anakin looks into padme's eyes. anakin i look forward to seeing naboo again. i've thought about it every day since i left. it's by far the most beautiful place i've ever seen... padme is a little unnerved by his intense stare. padm� you were just a little boy then. it may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception. anakin i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception. padm� it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like... anakin or be with the people i love. padm� are you allowed to love? i thought that was forbidden for a jedi. anakin attachment is forbidden. possession is forbidden. compassion, which i would define as unconditional love, is central to a jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love. padm� you have changed so much anakin you haven't changed a bit. you're exactly the way i remember you in my dreams. i doubt if naboo has changed much either. padm� it hasn't... anakin i can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. whenever i try to visualise the force, those hills are what i see. anakin looks at padme when he says this. anakin (continuing) i love naboo. there is an awkward moment. padm� (changing the subject) were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you? anakin yes... i left tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. i don't want to lose it. recently i've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. i worry about her. padme gives anakin a sympathetic look. ext. coruscant, downtown, back street - morning obi-wan walks down the street. it is a pretty tough part of town. old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through. obi-wan comes to a kind of alien diner. on the steamed-up windowa it says "dex's diner" in alien lettering. he goes inside. int. coruscant, dex's diner - morning a young waitress, hermione bagwa, is wiping off a booth tabletop. there is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. a number of customers are eating - tough-looking workers, freighter drivers etc. hermione looks up as obi-wan comes in. hermione can i help ya? obi-wan i'm looking for dexter. hermione's eyes narrow. hermione bagwa waddya want him for? obi-wan he's not in trouble. it's personal. hermione stares at obi-wan. there is a brief pause. then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter. hermione bagwa someone to see ya, honey (lowering her voice) a jedi, by the looks of him. steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through. dexter jettster obi-wan! obi-wan hey, dex. dexter jettster take a seat! be right with ya! obi-wan sits in a booth. hermione bagwa you want a cup of ardees? obi-wan thank you. hermione moves off as the door to the counter opens and dexter jettster appears. he is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. not someone to tangle with. he arrives, beaming hugely. dexter jettster hey, ol' buddy! obi-wan hey, dex. dexter eases himself into the seat opposite obi-wan. he can just make it. hermione sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them. dexter jettster so, my friend. what can i do for ya? obi-wan you can tell me what this is. obi-wan places the dart on the table between them. dex's eyes widen. he puts down his mug. dexter jettster well, whattaya know... dexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it. dexter jettster (continuing) i ain't seen one of these since i was prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim! obi-wan do you know where it came from? dexter grins. he puts the dart down between them. dexter jettster this baby belongs to them cloners. what you got here is a kamino kyberdart. obi-wan kamino kyberdart... i wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive. dexter jettster it's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. i should think you jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom. obi-wan well, dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? (laughing) kamino... doesn't sound familiar. is it part of the republic? dexter jettster no, it's beyond the outer rim. i'd say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze, toward the south. it should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. those kaminoans keep to themselves. they're cloners. damned good ones, too. obi-wan then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them. obi-wan cloners? are they friendly? dexter jettster it depends. obi-wan on what, dex? dexter grins. dexter jettster on how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is... ext. naboo spaceport - day the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed. padme, anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area. they exit onto the main plaza. ext. naboo palace, grand courtyard (naboo) - afternoon the speeder bus pulls up and stops. padme, anakin, and artoo get out. the great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. artoo whistles. they pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. artoo trundles behind them. anakin if i grew up here, i don't think i'd ever leave. padm� (laughing) i doubt that. anakin no, really. when i started my training, i was very homesick and very lonely. this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about... the problem was, the more i thought about my mom, the worse i felt. but i would feel better if i thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers... padm� ...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. the first time i saw the capital, i was very young... i'd never seen a waterfall before. i though they were so beautiful... i never dreamed one day i'd live in the palace. anakin well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl? padm� (laughing) no! that was the last thing i thought of. my dream was to help in the "refugee relief movement." i never thought of running for elected office. but the more history i studied, the more i realised how much good politicians could do. so when i was eight, i joined the "apprentice legislators", then later on became a senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before i knew it, i was elected queen. partly because i scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. i wasn't the youngest queen ever elected, but now that i think back on it, i'm not sure i was old enough. i'm not sure i was ready. anakin the people you served thought you did a good job. i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office. padm� popular rule is not democracy, annie. it gives the people what they want, not what they need. and, truthfully, i was relieved when my two terms were up. so were my parents. they worried about me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. actually, i was hoping to have a family by now... my sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the queen asked me to serve as senator, i couldn't refuse her. anakin i agree! i think the republic needs you... i'm glad you chose to serve. i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways. padm� i think so too. anakin and padme walk toward the palace. artoo continues to follow. int. naboo palace, throne room - afternoon quen jamillia is seated on the throne, flanked by sio bibble and a couple of advisors. four handmaidens stand close by, and guards are at the doors. queen jamillia we've been worried about you. (takes her hand) i'm so glad you're safe, padm�. padm� thank you, your highness. i only wish i could have served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote. sio bibble given the circumstances, senator, you know it was the only decision her highness could have made. queen jamillia how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists? padm� about two hundred. and more are leaving the republic every day. if the senate votes to create an army, i'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. sio bibble it's unthinkable! there hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the republic! queen jamillia do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the republic? padm� not if they feel threatened. the separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. i'm sure of that. and with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help. queen jamillia the armies of commerce! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them? padm� i'm afraid that, despite the chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds. sio bibble it's outrageous! after all of those hearings, and the four trials in the supreme court, nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation. do those money mongers control everything? queen jamillia remember, counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the federation's armies. that's a move in the right direction. padm� there are rumours, your highness, that the federation army was not reduced as they were ordered. anakin the jedi have not been allowed to investigate. it would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told. queen jamillia we must keep our faith in the republic. the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. padm� let's pray that day never comes. queen jamillia in the meantime, we must consider your own safety. sio bibble signals. all the other advisors and attendants bow and leave the room. sio bibble (to anakin) what is your suggestion, master jedi? padm� anakin's not a jedi yet, counsellor. he's still a padawan learner. i was thinking... anakin (nettled) hey, hold on a minute! padm� excuse me! i was thinking i would stay in the lake country. there are some places up there that are very isolated. anakin excuse me?! i am in charge of security here, m'lady. sio bibble and queen jamillia exchange a look. something is going on here. padm� annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. i know it very well... that is why we're here. i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance. anakin (takes a deep breath) sorry, m'lady. sio bibble (to anakin, amused) she is right. the lake country is the most remote part of naboo. not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. queen jamillia perfect. it's settled then. anakin glares at padme. then queen jamillia gets up, and they all start to leave. queen jamillia (continued) padm�, i had an audience with your father yesterday. i told him what was happening. he hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you. padme looks worred. they all exit down the main staircase. ext. jedi temple - day the main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. all sorts of jedi are coming and going. int. jedi temple, archives library - day a bronze bust of count dooku, stands among a line of other busts of jedi in the archive room. obi-wan stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face. on the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. farther along the room in the background, five jedi are seated at tables, studying archival material. after obi-wan studies the bust for a few moments before madame jocasta nu, the jedi archivist is standing next to him. she is an elderly, frail-looking human jedi. tough as old boots and smart as a whip. jocasta nu did you call for assistance? obi-wan (distracted in thought) yes... yes, i did... jocasta nu he has a powerful face, doesn't he? he was one of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of knowing. obi-wan i never understood why he quit. only twenty jedi have ever left the order. jocasta nu (sighs) the lost twenty... and count dooku was the most recent and the most painful. no one likes to talk about it. his leaving was a great loss to the order. obi-wan what happened? jocasta nu well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the council... much like your old master, qui-gon jinn. obi-wan (surprised) really? jocasta nu oh, yes. they were alike in many ways. very individual thinkers... idealists... jocasta nu stares at the bust jocasta nu (continuing he was always striving to become a more powerful jedi. he wanted to be the best. with a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. his knowledge of the force was... unique. in the end, i think he left because he lost faith in the republic. he believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. he always had very high expectations of government. he disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement. obi-wan interesting... i'm still not sure i understand. jocasta nu well, i'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. are you having a problem, master kenobi? obi-wan yes, i'm trying to find a planet system called kamino. it doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts. jocasta nu kamino? it's not a system i'm familiar with... let me see... jocasta nu leans over obi-wan's shoulder, looking at the screen. jocasta nu (continuing) are you sure you have the right co-ordinates? obi-wan (nodding) according to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the rishi maze. jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns. jocasta nu no co-ordinates? it sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or furbog trader. obi-wan all three actually. jocasta nu are you sure it exists? obi-wan absolutely. jocasta nu let me do a gravitational scan. obi-wan and jocasta nu studt the star map hologram. jocasta nu there are some inconsistencies here. maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed. obi-wan wouldn't that be on record? jocasta nu it ought to be. unless it was very recent. (shakes her head) i hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist. obi-wan that's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete. jocasta nu the archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young jedi. one thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist! obi-wan stares at her, then looks back at the map. ext. theed, residential area, side street - afternoon people are passing through the little street, old men are sunning themslves, women are gossipping, kids are playing. anakin, padme and artoo turn onto a side street. anakin is back in his jedi robes. padme wear a beautiful simple dress. she stops, beaming. padme there's my house! padme starts forward; anakin hangs back. padme (continuing) what? don't say you're shy! anakin (untruthfully) no, but i... suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, ryoo (age 6) and pooja (age 4). they come running toward padme. ryoo & pooja aunt padme!! aunt padme!! padme ryoo!! pooja!! padme scoops up ryoo and pooja and hugs them. padme (continuing) i'm so happy to see you! this is anakin. anakin, this is ryoo, and this is pooja. anakin and the girls say hello shyly. then: ryoo & pooja artoo!!! as they see the droid, they hug him. artoo whistles and beeps. padme laughs. anakin and padme go on toward the house. the girls stay and play with artoo. int. padme's parents' house, main room - afternoon sola, padme's beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food. sola (over her shoulder) they're eating over at jev narran's later, mom. they just had a snack. they'll be fine. sola puts the bowl down on the table, where anakin, padme and ruwee naberrie (padme's father) are coming into the room. padme anakin, this is my sister, sola. sola hello, anakin. anakin hello. sola sits, as jobal naberrie (padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food. jobal you're just in time for dinner. i hope you're hungry, anakin. anakin a little. padme he's being polite, mom. we're starving. ruwee (grinning) you came to the right place at the right time. sit down, son. everyone sits and starts passing food. jobal (to padme) honey, it's so good to see you safe. we were so worried. padme gives jobal a dirty look. ruwee smiles as he watches. ruwee dear... jobal i know, i know... but i had to say it. now it's done. sola well, this is exciting! do you know, anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home? padme (rolls her eyes) sola!! he isn't my boyfriend! he's a jedi assigned by the senate to protect me. joval a bodyguard?! oh, padme! they didn't tell us it was that serious! padme it's not, mom, i promise. (glances at jobal) anyway, anakin's a friend. i've known him for years. remember that little boy who was with the jedi during the blockade crisis? they nod. padme (continuing) he grew up. jobal honey, when are you going to settle down? haven't you had enough of that life? i certainly have! padme mom, i'm not in any danger. ruwee (to anakin) is she? anakin ...yes... i'm afraid she is. padme (quickly) but not much. ext. padme's parents' garden - afternoon anakin and ruwee are walking. ruwee sometimes i wish i'd traveled more... but i must say, i'm happy here. anakin padme tells me you teach at the university? ruwee (nodding) yes, and before that, i was a builder. i also worked for the refugee relief movement, when i was very young. int. padme's parents' house, main room - afternoon padme, sola and jobal are clearing the table. sola why haven't you told us about him? padm� what's there to talk about? he's just a boy. sola a boy? have you seen the way he looks at you? padm� sola - stop it! sola it's obvious he has feelings for you. are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed? padm� i'm not your baby sister, sola. anakin and i are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. (to jobal) mom, would you tell her to stop it? sola (laughing) well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. i think you're afraid to. padm� cut it out. jobal sola's just concerned... we all are. padm� oh, mom, you're impossible. what i'm doing is important. jobal you've done your service, padm�. it's time you had a life of your own. you're missing so much! ext. padme's parents' garden - afternoon anakin and ruwee are walking in the garden. ruwee stops and faces anakin directly. ruwee now tell me, son. how serious is this thing? how much danger is my daughter really in? anakin there have been two attempts on her life. chances are there'll be more. my master is tracking down the assassins. i'm sure he'll find out who they are. this situation, won't last long. ruwee i don't want anything to happen to her. anakin i don't either. int. padme's parents' house, padme's room - afternoon padme throws some things into a bag. padme don't worry, this won't take long. anakin i just want to get there before dark. padme goes on packing. anakin looks around the room. anakin (continuing) you still live at home. padme i move around so much, i've never had a place of my own. official residences have no warmth. i feel good here. i feel at home. anakin i never had a real home. home was always where my mom was. anakin picks up a framed hologram. anakin (continuing) is this you? the hologram shows padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. she is holding one in her arms. they are all smiling hugely. padme that was when i went with the relief group to shadda-bi-boran. their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. i was helping to relocate the children. see that little one i'm holding? his name was n'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. he was so full of life,. all those kids were. i did everything i could to save him, but he died... they all did. they were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet. anakin picks up another hologram. it shows padme at age ten or eleven. she is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. her expression is severe. padme (continuing) my first day as an apprentice legislator. notice the difference? padme pulls a face. anakin grins. she continues packing. anakin sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent. int. jedi temple, main hallway - day obi-wan walks through the main hallway to the training area. int. jedi temple, training veranda - day obi-wan comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching twenty or so four-year-olds doing training exercises, supervised by yoda. they wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers. the droids dance in front of them. yoda don't think... feel... be as one with the force. help you, it will. (he sees obi-wan) younglings - enough! a visitor we have. welcome him. the children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. yoda (continuing) master obi-wan kenobi, meet the mighty bear clan. children welcome, master obi-wan! obi-wan i am sorry to disturb you, master. yoda what help to you, can i be? obi-wan i�m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. i trust him. but the system doesn�t show up on the archive maps. yoda an interesting puzzle. gather round the map reader, younglings. master obi-wan has lost a planet. find it, we will try... the map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. the cchildren gather around it. obi-wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. the window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. the children laugh. some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. obi-wan walks into the display. obi-wan this is where it ought to be... but it isn�t. gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. there should be a star here... but there isn�t. yoda most interesting. gravity�s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. how can this be? there is a brief pause. then a child puts its hand up. yoda nods. jedi child jack because someone erased it from the archive memory. children that�s right! yes! that�s what happened! someone erased it! jedi child may if the planet blew up, the gravity would go away. obi-wan stares; yoda chuckles. yoda truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. uncluttered. to the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. obi-wan but master yoda who could have erased information from the archives? that�s impossible, isn�t it? yoda (frowning) much harder to answer, that question is. ext. naboo lake retreat, water speeder, landing platform - late afternoon a water speeder driven by paddy accu, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome naboo starship rests. anakin and padme are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake. ext. naboo lake retreat, lodge, garden terracem late afternoon anakin and padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. behind them, paddy accu supervises two serving girls, nandi and teckla, as they carry the bags into the lodge. anakin and padme stop at the balustrade. padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. anakin looks at her silently. padm� when i was in level three, we used to come here for school retreat. see that island? we used to swim there every day. i love the water. anakin i do too. i guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. padme becomes aware that anakin is looking at her. padm� ...we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. anakin i don�t like sand. it�s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. not like here. here everything�s soft... and smooth... he touches her arm. padme has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous. padm� there was a very old man who lived on the island. he used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. they were magical. anakin (looks into her eyes) everything here is magical. padm� you could look into the glass and see the water. the way it ripples and moves. it looked so real... but it wasn�t. anakin sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. real enough, anyway... they look into each other's eyes. he touches her chin. padm� i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself. anakin i think it's true... anakin kisses padme. she doesn't resist. she comes to her senses and pulls away. padm� i shouldn't have done that. anakin i'm sorry. when i'm around you, my mind is no longer my own. padm� it's the situation... the stress... he looks at her. anakin ...the view. ext. coruscant, landing platform - late afternoon obi-wan's starfighter is ready for takeoff. obi-wan and mace windu stand beside it. mace windu be wary, this disturbance in the force is growing stronger. obi-wan i am concerned for my padawan. he is not ready to be on his own. yoda the council is confident in this decision, obi-wan. mace he has exceptional skills. the council is confident in its decision, obi-wan. if the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the force. obi-wan but he still has much to learn. and his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. i realise now what you and master yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and... obi-wan hesitates. mace windu there's something else? obi-wan master, he should not have been given this assignment. i'm afraid anakin won't be able to protect the senator. mace windu why? obi-wan he has a... an emotional connection with her. it's been there since he was boy. now he's confused... distracted. mace-windu obi-wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path. obi-wan climbs into the cockpit of the starfighter. obi-wan has master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about? mace windu probing the dark side is a dangerous process. he could be in seclusion for days... may the force be with you. int. jedi temple, yoda's quarters - late afternoon yoda sits with his eyes closed, meditating. silence. ext. naboo lake retreat, lounge, late afternoon the setting sun touches the mountain peaks. the lake glows in the rose-tinted light. floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge. int. naboo lake retreat, dining room - late afternoon nandi place dessert in front of padme. teckla does the same for anakin. the dessert is some kind of fruit. padme picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! she frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. she lokk up at anakin. his eyes are on his plate. padme you did that? anakin looks up - wide-eyed innocence. anakin what? padme scowls at him. padme jabs at the fruit - anakin subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her. padme that! now stop it! padme laughs. anakin laughs. she reaches out for the fruit - it loops. padme (continuing) anakin!! anakin moves his fingers. the fruit flies into his hand. anakin i'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, i mean. if master obi-wan were here, he'd be very grumpy. anakin is pleased. he cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to padme. she bites it out of the air and laughs. int. naboo lake retreat, lodge, fireplace alcove - twilight a fire blazes in the open hearth. padme is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames. she looks up as anakin arrives. she makes room for him. brief pause. anakin may i tell you something? padme i don't know. anakin then how can i tell you? padme maybe you should use your jedi intuition. anakin it doesn't work around you. my mind is always a muddle... i can only think of you. padme anakin, don't... anakin from the moment i met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when i haven't thought of you. and now that i'm close to you again, i'm in agony. the closer i get to you, the worse it gets. the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. i feel dizzy. i can't breathe. i'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. my heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. you are in my very soul, tormenting me. what can i do? i will do anything you ask... silence. the logs flame in the hearth. anakin (continuing) if you are suffering as much as i am, tell me. padme ...i can't. we can't. it's just not possible. anakin anything's possible. padme, please listen... padme you listen. we live in a real world. come back to it. you're studying to become a jedi knight. i'm a senator. if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. anakin then you do feel something! there's an extraordinary connection between us. you can't deny that. padme annie, it doesn't make any difference. jedi aren't allowed to marry. you swore an oath, remember? you'd be expelled from the order. i will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. anakin i was destined to be a jedi. i don't think i could be anything else. but you are asking me to be rational. that is something i know i cannot do. i wish i could wish my feelings away... but i can't. padme i am not going to give into this. i'm not going to throw my life away. i have more important things to do than fall in love. there is silence as they stare at the fire. anakin is thinking. anakin it wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret. padme then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. mt sister saw it. so did my mother. i couldn't do that. could you, anakin? could you live like that? silence for a moment. anakin ...no, you're right. it would destroy us. ext. space it's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. obi-wan's starship flies over camera and heads down toward the planet. ext. tipoca city, kamino landing platform (rainstorm) - day heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as obi-wan's starship approaches. the huge, ultra-modern city of tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. the starfighter lands. obi-wan gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. a door slides open. a shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. obi-wan passes through it and goes inside. int. tipoca city, corridor entrance a brilliant white light. obi-wan pushes the soaking hood from his face. taun we welcome to tipoca city, master jedi. obi-wan wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named taun we. he has large, almond shaped eyes. taun we everything is ready. the prime minister expects you. obi-wan (warily) i'm expected? taun we of course! he is anxious to see you. after all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. now please, this way! obi-wan masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. obi-wan follows taun we cautiously. int. tipoca city, prime minister office - day the door slides open. obi-wan and taun we enter and cross to where lama su rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on kamino, seems made out of pure light. taun we may i present lama su, prime minister of kamino... and this is master jedi... obi-wan obi-wan kenobi. lama su please... lama su indicates a chair. obi-wan sits. taun we hovers. the room is bathed in brilliant white light. the whole place is ultra high-tech. lama su i trust you are going to enjoy your stay. we are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. obi-wan you make me feel most welcome. lama su and now to business. you will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way. obi-wan (improvising) that is... good news. lama su please tell your master sido-dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. he is well, i hope? obi-wan i'm sorry master - ? lama su jedi master sifo-dyas. he's still a leading member of the jedi council, is he not? obi-wan oh, yes. sido-dyas. lama su (rising) you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. obi-wan that's why i'm here. ext. naboo, mountain meadow - later afternoon padme and anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. at a distance, a herd of shaaks graze contentedly. beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. several other lakes stretch to the horizon. the warm air is full of little floating puffballs. they sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. padme is picking flowers. padm� i don't know... anakin sure you do... you just don't want to tell me. padm� are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me? anakin they only work on the weak-minded. you are anything but weak-minded. padm� all right... his name was palo. i was twelve. we were both in the legislative youth program. he was a few years older then i... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes. anakin all right, i get the picture... whatever happened to him? padm� i went on to become a queen. he went on to become an artist. anakin maybe he was the smart one. padme you really don't like politicians, do you? anakin i like two or three, but i'm not really sure about one of them. (smiling) i don't think the system works. padme how would you have it work? anakin we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it. padme that is exactly what we do. the trouble is that people don't wlways agree. in fact, they hardly ever do. anakin then they should be made to. padme by whom? who's going to make them? anakin i don't know. someone. padme you? anakin of course not me. padme but someone. anakin someone wise. padme that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. a mischievious little grin creeps across his face. anakin well, if it works... padme stares at anakin. he looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile. padm� you're making fun of me. anakin (sarcastic) on no, i'd be much too frightened to tease a senator. padm� you're so bad! padme picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. he catches it. padme throws two more pieces of fruit, and anakin catches them. anakin you're always so serious. always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders. anakin then starts to juggle the fruit. padme laughs and throws more fruit at him. he manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. they both laugh. anakin stands in front of a shaak, yelling at it and waving his arms. padme starts laughing as anakin runs in circles, chased by the shaak. the shaak crosses in front of padme. anakin is riding it, facing the shaak's tail. the shaak bucks, and anakin falls off. padme laughs even harder. anakin lies still. padme jumps uip and runs to where anakin is face down in the grass. she turns him over. he is pulling a stupid face at her. she yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. he catches her arm. she struggles. they roll over in the grass. suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. they let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away. anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her. she take it. he pulls her up. and now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. padme scrambles up onto the shaak behind anakin. she puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. abajub digs his heels in. the shaak starts forward, and they ride away. ext. tipoca city, parade ground (rainstorm) - day obi-wan, lama su and taun we come out onto a balcony. below is a huge parade ground. the rain and wind are brutal. thousands of stormtroopers, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred. lama su (beaming) magnificent, aren't they?

lama su a bounty hunter called jango fett. we felt a jedi would be the perfect choice, but sido-dyas hand- picked jango fett himself. obi-wan where is this bounty hunter now? lama su oh, we keep him here. after a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. he lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases. int. tipoca city, clone center, barracks - day the tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which clones are climbing. once in the tube, the clone goes to sleep. lama su apart from his pay, which is considerable, fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. curious isn't it?

lama su about five years ago. int. tipoca city, clone center, hatchery - day they enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which embryos are suspended. lama su they're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action. obi-wan very impressive. lama su i'd hoped you would be pleased. obi-wan gazes at the nearest embryos. obi-wan (carefully) tell me, prime minister, when my master sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or? lama su himself? of course not. this army is for the republic? obi-wan (astonished) the repubic? lama su we are also very much agasint this count dooku and his seccessionist movement. we are proud to be of help to the republic. int. tipoca city, apartment - late day taun we shows obi-wan into his room. taun we i have arranged for you to meet jango fett in the morning. sleep well. taun we goes. the door slides closed behind him. obi-wan looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink. obi-wan arfour, arfour... ext. tipoca city landing platform, jedi fighter, (rainstorm) - late day the r4 d17, obi-wan's astro-droid, who is sitting on top of obi-wan's starfighter, switches on and beeps. int. tipoca city, apartment - late day obi-wan hears arfour beep through his comlink. obi-wan arfour, relay this, "scramble code five," to courscant: care of "the old folks home." ext. tipoca city landing platform, jedi fighter, (rainstorm) - late day arfour beeps and whistles. the panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted. ext. jedi temple, livinf quarters - early evening yoda and mace windu listen as a hologram of obi-wan stands between them broadcasting the massage. the singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out. obi-wan (v.o.) ...i've never heard of a jedi called sido-dyas, have you, master? mace windu no. whoever placed that order was not a jedi, i can assure you. obi-wan (v.o.) i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for. yoda who he is working for... discover that, you must. obi-wan (v.o.) i will, master, and i will also find out more about this clone army... may the force... the hologram switches off, and obi-wan fades away. windu a clone army! ordered by someone in the senate perhaps... someone's out to start a war. yoda inform the chancellor of this, we must. windu who do you think this impostor sido-dyas, could be?

yoda with the forename darth, a sith he must be. mace windu our missing apprentice. they are playing their hand at last. obi-wan do you believe he could be the mysterious sido-dyas, who made the deal for the clone army? yoda perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are. mace windu be careful, obi-wan. this investigation is becoming less than routine. do you need help? obi-wan let me see if i can figure out what's going on first. the hologram of obi-wan fades off. palpatine stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief. bail organa the commerce guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that. palpatine count dooku must have made a treaty with them. mace windu we must stop them soon before they're fully ready. senator ask aak the debate is over, we need that clone army now! bail organa unfortunately, the debate is not over. the senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack. mas amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up. mas amedda this is a crisis! if the senate votes the chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute. palpatine please, please, i don't wish to have emergency powers. that's too extreme a solution. it's akin to a dictatorship. we must rely on the jedi. master yoda, how many are available to go to geonosis? mace windu and yoda look at one another. yoda two hundred,... less or more. bail organa with all due respect for the jedi order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids. mace windu patience. we should wait for obi- wan to report back. we don't know that count dooku has made a treaty with the corporate alliance, it's speculation. senator ask aak but we must prepare for the worst. i'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the chancellor at the next session. we must not wait! palpatine out of the question, senator! you and i are too closely aligned. the issue will become partisan and debates will begin. the proposal must come from a neutral source. mas amedda if only senator amidala were here. jar jar steps forward from the back of the group. jar jar supreme chancellor... my august colleagues, i would be proud to propose the motion in question. this is a grave situation, and i'm sure senator amidala, and the queen of naboo would agree. senator ask aak thank you, representative binks. silence. then palpatine sighs deeply. palpatine if called upon, i will serve. but it will be the saddest day of my life. ext. tatooine, desert, homestead moisture farm - day all is quiet. beru comes out of the house. she goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water. int. tatooine, homestead, garage - day padme fixes the last piece of covering onto threepio. padme there! padme stands back. owen is with her. they look at threepio. he isn't the golden figure we know because padme has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. he is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete. c-3po um. how do i look?

he's your friend... your mentor... anakin ...he's like my father, but you heard master windu. he gave me strict orders to stay here. padme he gave you strict orders to protect me... padme pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. the engines fire. padme (continuing) ...and i'm going to save obi-wan. so if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along. anakin grins and takes the controls. ext. tatooine, bluff overlooking homestead - sunset the naboo starship rises from the bluff and zooms away. ext. coruscant, jedi temple - day two hundred jedi knights are assembling outside the huge center of the jedi order. int. coruscant, jedi temple, council chamber - day the jedi council are assembled as mace windu makes his plea. mace windu the longer we wait, the stronger dooku's armies become. we cannot wait for the senate to make up its mind about granting the chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... we have the authority to go now. we must go now. all of the jedi council nod their approval. yoda agreed, master windu. two hundred jedi send. enough, let's hope they are. int. coruscant, main senate chamber - day inside the great rotunda, the uproar is even louder. opposing senatoes yell furiously at one another. mas amedda order! order!! finally, the uproar dies. palpatine in the regrettable absence of senator amidala, the chair recognises senior representative of naboo, jar jar binks. amid the conflicting storm of cheers and boos, jar jar, with two gungan aides, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. he looks at palpatine nervously. palpatine nods. jar jar clears his throat. jar jar senators, dellow felagates... laughter. jeers. jar jar blushes. mas amedda order! the senate will accord the representative the courtesy of a hearing! comparative quiet. jar jar grips the edge of the podium. jar jar in response to the direct threat to the republic from the confederacy of independent systems, i propose that the senate gives immediate emergency powers to the supreme chancellor. uproar. jar jar looks a little sheepish. jar jar (continuing) who can deny these are exceptional times? exceptional times demand exceptional measures! exceptional measures demand exceptional men! orn free taa we won't support a dictator. shouts of agreement. jar jar that is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! and when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the supreme chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before! brief silence, then a rolling wave of applause. jar jar beams and bows. palpatine rises. palpatine it is with great reluctance that i have agreed to this calling. i love democracy... i love the republic. the fact that this crisis is demanding i be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. but i am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. the power you give me i will lay down when this crisis has abated, i promise you. and all i ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace. mas amedda we shall proceed to the vote. all those in favor of granting emergency powers to the supreme chancellor, signal ate at this time... those opposed? ext. space the naboo starship heads toward the rings of geonosis. ext. geonosis, landing area the naboo starship lands. int. cockpit, naoo starfighter - day anakin switches off the engines. artoo and threepio are in the navigation area of the cockpit. padme is in the co-pilot's seat. she gets up. anakin hey, where are you going? padme to find obi-wan. anakin gets up and goes over to her. anakin no! you're not! he grabs her arm. padme let go of me! anakin i'm not letting you go out there. it's too dangerous. padm� what?!? anakin it's my job to protect you. i said it's too dangerous. you're not going, and that's final! padm� don't you give me orders, annie! i'm a senator of the galactic republic. you have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! you remember your place, young man. (standing up) now you can come along and protect me or stay here. it's up to you. padme storms out of the cockpit of the naboo starfighter. anakin stands scratching his head, then follows. artoo beeps and whistles. c-3po yes, it is, artoo. most confusing. one moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. even though i'm programmed to understand them, i doubt if i ever shall. artoo whistles a plaintive sigh. int. geonosis, corridors - day anakin and padme enter the stalagmite city. they stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness. padme (in a low voice) it's empty! they start forward. as they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. high above winged creatures grow from the pillars and detach themselves. int. geonosis, central square - day anakin and padme cross the square, reaching the middle. they stop suddenly as four geonosians grabs them. anakin reaches for his lightsaber. padme wait! twenty winged geonosians carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them. the geonosians part, and count dooku appears. he bows courteously. count dooku senator amidala, i've heard so much about you. padm� count dooku, i assume. count dooku i'm delighted to meet you at last. we have a great deal to discuss, senator. i hope you can keep your young jedi under control. padm� don't worry he's housebroken. int. conference room (geonosis) - day count dooku sits at a large conference table with padme on the far side. anakin stands behind her with four geonosians guards standing behind him. jango fett stands behind count dooku, and six geonosian guards stand behind him. padm� you are holding a jedi knight, obi- wan kenobi. i am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now. dooku he has been convicted of espionage, senator, and will be executed. in just a few hours, i believe. count dooku smiles. padm� he is an officer of the republic. you can't do that. dooku we don't recognise the republic here, senator. but if naboo were to join our alliance, i could easily hear your plea for clemency. anakin grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on. padm� and if i don't join your rebellion, i assume this jedi with me will also die? dooku i don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and i assume you want to do what's in their best interest. aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. aren't you? be honest, senator. padm� the ideals are still alive, count, even if the institution is failing. dooku you believe in the same ideals we believe in! the same ideals we are striving to make prominent. padm� if what you say is true, you should stay in the republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right. dooku the chancellor means well, m'lady but he is incompetent. he has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? senator, the republic cannot be fixed. it is time to start over. the democratic process in the republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. it will not be long before the cult of greed, called the republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom. padm� i cannot believe that. i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic. i know of your treaties with the trade federation, the commerce guilds, and the others, count. what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government! dooku are you willing to betray your jedi friends? without your co-operation i can do nothing to stop their execution. padm� what is to happen to me? am i to be executed also? dooku i wouldn't think of such an offence. but, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, m'lady. it has nothing to do with politics, i'm afraid. it's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. i'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. i'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, i must turn you over to the geonosians for justice. i've done all i can for you. jango fett moves over to anakin. jango fett i'll take that weapon. anakin hesitates. dooku you may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young jedi, but you will not escape. padm� anakin... anakin hands his lightsaber over to jango fett. int. geonosis, high audience chamber - day anakin and padme are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is poggle the lesser, archduke of geonosis. he is accompanied by his underling, sun rit. off to one side the separatist senators po nudu, tessek, and toonbuck toora. next to them are the commerce dignitaries, shu mai, nute gunray, passel argente, wat tambor and san hill of the intergalactic bank clan. along the wall about a hundred geonosians wait for a verdict. sun rit you have been charged and found guilty of espionage. poggle do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out? padm� you are committing an act of war, archduke. i hope you are prepared for the consequences. poggle laughs. count dooku simply smiles. poggle we build weapons, senator... that is our business! of course we're prepared! nute gunray get on with it. carry out the sentence. i want to see her suffer. poggle your other jedi friend is waiting for you, senator. take them to the arena! four guards take hold of padme and anakin. they are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling. int. geonosis tunnel to execution arena - day in the gloomy tunnel, anakin and padme are tossed into an open cart. the murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. guards extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other. the driver gets up onto his seat. anakin don't be afraid. padm� i'm not afraid to die. i've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. anakin what are you talking about? padm� i love you. anakin you love me?! i thought we decided not to fall in love. that we would be forced to live a lie. that it would destroy our lives... padm� i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. my love for you is a puzzle, annie, for which i have no answers. i can't control it... and now i don't care. i truly, deeply love you, and before we die i want you to know. padme leans toward anakin. by straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet. they kiss. anakin i have no desire to be cured of this love either. long or short, i vow to spend the rest of my life with you. they kiss again. the driver cracks his whip over the orray harnessed between the shafts. the cart jerks forward. suddenly, there isa huge roar and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena int. geonosis, execution arena - day the great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling geonosians. the cart trundles to the center, where obi-wan is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. the cart stops. padme and anakin are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. padme is in the center. obi-wan i was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message. anakin i retransmitted it as you requested, master. then we decided to come and rescue you. obi-wan it looks like you're going a good job so far. their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. there is another roar as poggle the lesser, count dooku, nute gunray, the fetts and dignitaries arrive in the archducal box and take their places. sun rit the felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the sovereign system of geonosis. their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth. the crowd roars and cheers. in the box, poggle the lesser rises. the crowd becomes quiet. poggle let the executions begin! the crowd goes wild. anakin i have a bad feeling about this. from different gates around the arena, three monsters are driven in. one is a reek (bull-like), one is a nexu (lion-like), and one is an acklay (a kind of dino-lobster). they are driven in by picadors carrying long spears and riding orrays. the picadors poke the monsters toward the center, then retire to the perimeter. the monsters toss their heads, looking around, roaring or screeching. then they catch sight of the three captives and start moving toward them. obi-wan take the one the left. i'll take the one on the right. anakin what about padme? padme has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free. obi-wan it looks like she's already on top of things. the reek charges anakin. he jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. anakin lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. the reek backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post obi-wan ducks around the post as the acklay charges. it knocks the post flat, sending obi-wan sprawling. the acklay crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. obi-wan leaps up and runs towards one of the picadors. the acklay taks off after him. the nexu arrives at padme's post and rears on its hind legs. one top, padme struggles to tear the chain free. the nexu roars, displaying wicked, dripping fangs. in the archducal box, nute gunray beams and rubs his hands. in the arena, obi-wan runs at the picador. the orray rears up. obi-wan grabs the picador's long spear and pole vaults over him. the chasing acklay smashes into the orray. it goes down. the picador tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the acklay and crunched. anakin's reek starts to buck. it charges around the arena with anakin hanging on for dear life. he whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the reek's mouth. its jaws clamp hard on the chain. anakin yanks hard on the chain, turning the reek, beginning to ride it. the nexu's claws dig deep into the post. the cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at padme. she turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. she hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. then, padme jumps off the post into the air. she swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. it tumbles back onto the sand. in the archducal box: nute gunray foul!! she can't do that... shoot her or something! in the arena, obi-wan runs out from behind the fallen orray and throws the spear at the acklay, hitting it in the neck. it lets out a terrible screech and turns on him. the nexu springs up and makes to leap up at padme again. she finally manages to work the chain loose. anakin comes charging up on the reek. anakin you okay? padme (nods, gasping) sure! well, sort of. anakin jump!!! the nexu springs. padme leaps from the top of the post to land on the reek in front of anakin. he hauls her upright. the reek charges away, around the arena. the nexu bounds after it. the reek passes the wounded acklay. the nexu smells the blood and turns aside to attack the acklay. the two monsters fight. the crowd groans and boos. in the archducal box, nute gunray turns angrily to count dooku. nute gunray this isn't how it's supposed to be! jango, finish her off. count dooku motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. boba fett is enjoying the spectacle. count dooku (smiling enigmatically) patiece, viceroy... she will die. maybe this is the way it's supposed to end. obi-wan runs and jumps on the back of the reek behind anakin. across the arena, the nexu, having chewed up the acklay, starts to advance toward them. int. cockpit, naboo starship - day artoo beeps c-3po yes, it has been rather a long time. do you suppose something's happened to them? artoo beeps and whistles. c-3po (continuing) danger? oh no, i shouldn't think so. it looks a very dull planet to me. they should be back shortly. just stop worrying, artoo. ext. geonosis, execution arena - day in the archducal box, amid the uproar, count dooku feels a tap on his shoulder. he turns to see mace windu standing behind him. count dooku masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees jedi knights standing at every entrance and exit. count dooku master windu, how pleasant of you to join us. you're just in time for the moment of truth. i would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training. mace windu sorry to disappoint you, dooku. this party's over. mace windu signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about one hundred jedi switch on their lightsabers. the crowd is suddenly silent. count dooku's lips curl in slight amusement. count dooku (to mace windu) brave, but stupid, my old jedi friend. you're impossibly outnumbered. mace windu i don't think so. one jedi has to be worth a hundred geonosians. count dooku looks around the great theater. his smile grows. count dooku it wasn't the geonosians i was thinking about. how well do you think one jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids? count dooku signals. thousands of droids start to pour into all parts of the arena. mace windu draws his lightsaber, jango fett draws his guns and fires at mace windu, who deflects the shots. jango fett and mace windu jump into the arena, where they fight. boba fett wacthes his dad and the jedi master fight. the battle beginss. geonosians fly away everywhere. droids fire at jedi, who deflect the bolts and cult down the droids. the geonosian troops fire ray guns that are more difficult for the jedi to deflect. the reek and the nexu are spooked by the battle. the reek bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling droids and jedi that have moved into its path. padme picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. several jedi run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to obi-wan and anakin. among the crowd, jedi cut down swaths of geonosians and droids. on the sand, jedi fight, attacking droids. obi0wan and anakin swing their lightsabers, cutting droids in half. padme blasts away at droids and geonosians. int. cockpit, naboo starship artoo whistles. c-3po i don't hear anything. (artoo beeps) you're scaring me! stop imagining things! ext. geonosis, execution arena - day among the tiers, jedi are slowly being driven back. they have killed heaps of geonosians and have kncoked out piles of droids, but sheer numbers are telling. individual jedi are being cut down or blasted/ the rest are retreating into the arena. anakin and padme are back-to-back, fighting droids and flying geonosians. mace windu fights fiercely with jango fett. finally, the bounty hunter falls. his helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. the bounty hunter's body falls to the ground. mace windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with obi-wan, as they swipe and mangle droids. obi-wan someone's got to - shut down - these droids. mace windu don't worry! it's being - taken care of! ext. geonosis, federation starship - day ki-adi-mundi leads a raiding party of about twenty jedi through the lines of parked battle starships. they cut a swath through masses of droids until they arrive at the command starship. some jedi fall. the rest cut their way up the ramps and into the command ship. int. command federation starship, corridors - day ki-adi-mundi and teh surviving jedi fight their way through the corridors of the command ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing droids. int. command federation starship, control bridge - day they burst onto the bridge and chop down the command droids. the neimoidians flee in all directions. ke-adi-mundi leans over the control panel. he locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. it goes dark. instantly, all the droids on the starship and all the droids in the arena freeze! there is a moment of stunned silence, then the jedi cheer. one the bridge, plo koon claps ki-adi-mundi on the back. plo koon we've done it! now we have a chance! suddenly, there is a harsh beeping sound. all the droids on the starship and all the droids in the arena start fighting again! ki-adi-mundi stares in disbelief and dismay. ki-adi-mundi the system's off but they're still active. that's a new feature. they are independent of the control system. ext. geonosis, execution arena - day mace windu, obi-wan, anakin, padme and an exhausted group of about twenty jedi stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of battle droids. the bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of dead geonosians, shattered droids and jedi. at the foot of some steps, boba fett finds his father's battered helmet. he picks it up. ki-adi-mundi and the survivors from the raiding party are herded into the arena by superdroids. from the encircling tiers above, thousands of battle droids level their weapons menacingly. in the archducal box, count dooku lifts his hand. the droids lower their weapons. the count calls out to the jedi. count dooku master windu! silence. count dooku (continuing) you have fought gallantly. worthy of recognition in the history archives of the jedi order. now it is finished.

it's probably just a celebration artoo lets out an exhausted bleep. ext. battlefield, geonosis landscape - day gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids. int. gunship number two - day obi-wan, anakin and padme are at the open sides of the gunship. clones fire down at the droids below. the gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. it blasts it, but suddenly the gunship is rocked by a near miss. it lurches violently. obi-wan hold on! look over there... through the other side of the gunship, they see a geonosian speeder racing past. in the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of count dooku. anakin it's dooku, go after him! the pilot starts to comply, but... there is a huge blasts, the ship lurches on its side, and padme tumbles out. anakin (continuing) padme!!! anakin stares down in horror as padme hits thr ground below. anakin (continuing; to pilot) put the ship down! down! obi-wan no! forget her. we have to go after dooku. anakin no we're not!! land this ship! obi-wan don't let your personal feelings get in the way. we've got a job to do. below, padme hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after dooku. anakin i don't care!.. go back. obi-wan anakin! she's all right! look. anakin stares out to see padme rescued by clone troopers. obi-wan (continuing) follow that speeder! on the ground, padme looks up at gunship #2 as it speeds away after count dooku. obi-wan and anakin follow the speeder to a geonosian tower. the speeder decsends rapidly; the gunship follows. count dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the gunship parks next to it. obi-wan and anakin leap down and run inside the tower. int. geonosis, secret hanger tower - late day count dooku throws switches on a control panel. his interstellar sail ship is guarded by a squad of super battle droids. the doors of the exit-port slide open. droid captain your excellency! count dooku turns as obi-wan and anakin run in through the hanger doors. they draw their lightsabers. the droids raise their weapons. count dooku that won't be necessary, captain. stand down. and leave them to me. the droids lower their weapons and back off to the walls. count dooku looks at obi-wan and anakin with slight amusement. obi-wan (to anakin) we move in together - you slowly on the... anakin i'm taking him now! obi-wan anakin, no! anakin you'll pay for all the jedi you've killed today, dooku. anakin charges across the open space at count dooku, who smiles faintly, watching him come. anakin raises his lightsaber. at the last moment, count dooku thrusts out an arm, and anakin is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. he slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. count dooku moves toward obi-wan count dooku kenobi, isn't it? as you can see, my jedi powers are far beyond yours. now, back down. obi-wan i don't think so. obi-wan lifts his lightsaber. count dooku smiles. count dooku ah, but if i must. count dooku draws his lightsaber. he and obi-wan start to circle each other. count dooku (continuing) i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side. it gives me infinitely greater power. obi-wan you will have to prove it. obi-wan comes in fast, swinging at count dooku's head. dooku parries the cut easily. as they fight, it quickly becomes clear that dooku is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style. count dooku grand master kenobi, you disappoint me. yoda holds you in such high esteem. count dooku parried another cut. count dooku (continuing) surely you can do better...? (parries) no, i'm surprised. has jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? (cuts) which is it? count dooku thrusts. obi-wan steps back quickly, panting for breath. count dooku (continuing) come, come, master kenobi. put me out of my misery. obi-wan takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. for a moment, he drives count dooku back. then dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces obi-wan to retreat. count dooku increases the tempo of his attack. obi-wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself. dooku presses. his lightsaber flashes. obi-wan is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. he stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. his lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. count dooku raises his lightsaber. obi-wan looks up helplessly. dooku's lightsaber flashes down and clashes against - anakin's lightsaber! count dooku and anakin stare eyeball to eyeball. count dooku (continuing) that's brave of you, boy - but foolish. i would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson. anakin i'm a slow learner. and anakin charges at count dooku. the force of his attack catches the count slightly off balance. anakin's lightsaber flashes. count dooku draws back, putting a hand to his arm. he takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee anakin has nicked him. count dooku you have unusual powers, young padawan. but not enought to save you this time. anakin don't bet on it! obi-wan anakin! obi-wan uses the force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to anakin. with two lightsabers, anakin attacks. count dooku parries and ripostes. it is no contest. anakin is driven back against the wall. he loses one lightsaber. finally count dooku, in one flashing move, sends anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. anakin drops to the ground in agony. count dooku draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace. suddenly, the great doors slide open. the droids turn fast, raising their weapons. through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of yoda. he stops on the smoke-filled threashold, four droids lined up on either side of him, guns pointed. before the droids can get off a shot, yoda raises his hand, and the droids are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal. silence. count dooku steps away from anakin to face the jedi grand master. his lightsaber whirls in a formal salute. count dooku master yoda. at last we shall know who is the most powerful. yoda draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. he salutes formally. yoda count dooku. no interest in contests, do i have. count dooku charges across the space at yoda. he rains down blows upon the tiny figure. yoda doesn't budge an inch. for the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that dooku aims. nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. his energy drains. his strokes become feebler, slower. yoda attacks! he flies forward. count dooku is forced to retreat. wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of yoda's speed and swordplay. his lightsaber his a humming blur of light. count dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. he staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. yoda jumps onto dooku's shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the count's head. yoda (continuing) the end for you, count, this is. count dooku ...not yet... count dooku raises his arms and knocks yoda off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. it comes crashing down on obi-wan and anakin. but in the blink of and eye, yoda is under the crane, holding it up, using the force. yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. anakin is unconscious, and obi0wan tries toget out from under the crane. the fallen crane trembles and starts to life. behind it, the sound of the sail ship's engines are heard starting up. yoda concentrates harder. slowly, the crane rises. the sound of the engines increases. yoda exerts every scrap of his powers. the crane lifts clear of anakin and is thrown to the ground. dooku's sail ship takes off. obi-wan and anakin struggle to the exhausted yoda, but it's too late. the sail ship rises into the air and flies away. padm� and a clone captain with about ten troopers appear in the doorway. padm� anakin! padm� runs too him and throws her arms around him. anakin is barely able to stand up. the clone captain marches up to yoda, stops, and salutes smartly. clone captain resistance is at an end, general. what are your orders ? yoda looks at him and sighs. ext. coruscant, old town - dawn count dooku's interstellar sail ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of coruscant. count dooku manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands. int. coruscant, secret landing platform - dawn the ramp lowers. count dooku emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of darth sidious stands waiting. count dooku bows. count dooku the force is with us, my master. darth sidious welcome home, lord tyranus. you have done well. count dooku i bring you good news, my lord. the war has begun. darth sidious excellent. (smiling) everything is going as planned. ext. coruscant, jedi temple - sunset the beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun. int. jedi temple, council chamber - sunset mace windu where is your apprentice? obi-wan on his way back to naboo. he is escorting senator amidala home. they are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. yoda sits in his chair. obi-wan (continuing) i must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory. yoda victory? victory, you say? obi-wan turns and looks at the sad little jedi sitting in the council chamber. apart from ki-adi-mundi and plo koon, who is wounded, the chamber is empty. yoda (continuing) not victory, a defeat, it was... master obi-wan. begun, the clone war has! ext. naboo lake retreat, lodge, garden - late day in a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, anakin and padme stand before a naboo holy man. threepio and artoo stand by, watching, as the holy man blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, anakin and padme kiss. ext. coruscant, military staging area, balcony - late day palpatine, jar jar, bail organa and the other senators, with two royal guards, stand looking down at the square below. tens of thousands of clone troops are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the military assault ships. on the balcony, palpatine's expression is deeply sad. everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded assault ships take off. other land immediately in their place. the sky above is thick with transports. clone troops march and board the ships. the great clone war has begun... 
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
a star destroyer moves through space, releasing imperial probe robots from its underside. one of these probes zooms toward the planet hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface. an explosion marks the point of impact. ext. hoth - meteorite crater - snow plain - day a weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. a strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. the ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance. ext. plain of hoth - day a small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. the bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a tauntaun. curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast. the rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. pulling off his protective goggles, luke skywalker notices something in the sky. he takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. the wind whips at luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. his tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him. luke (into comlink) echo three to echo seven. han, old buddy, do you read me? after a little static a familiar voice is heard. han (over comlink) loud and clear, kid. what's up? luke (into comlink) well, i finished my circle. i don't pick up any life readings. han (over comlink) there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. the sensors are placed, i'm going back. luke (into comlink) right. i'll see you shortly. there's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. i want to check it out. it won't take long. luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. he pats the beast on the head to calm it. luke hey, steady girl. what's the matter? you smell something? luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. he hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him. it is a wampa ice creature, lunging at him ferociously. luke aaargh! luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. he falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken. the wampa ice creature grabs luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain. ext. hoth - rebel base entrance - day a stalwart figure rides his tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave. int. hoth - rebel base - main hangar deck rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base. the rider, han solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles. he walks into the main hangar deck toward the millennium falcon, which is parked among several fighters. mechanics, r2 units, and various other droids hurry about. han stops at the millennium falcon where his wookiee copilot, chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss. han chewie! the wookiee grumbles a reply. han all right, don't lose your temper. i'll come right back and give you a hand. chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as han leaves. int. hoth - rebel base - command center a makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice. the low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals. general rieekan straightens up from a console at han's approach. rieekan solo? han no sign of life out there, general. the sensors are in place. you'll know if anything comes around. rieekan commander skywalker reported in yet? han no. he's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. rieekan (indicates radar screen) with all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. taking a deep breath, han blurts out what is on his mind. han general, i've got to leave. i can't stay anymore. princess leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. her hair is braided across her head in a nordic fashion. she overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed. rieekan i'm sorry to hear that. han well, there's a price on my head. if i don't pay off jabba the hut, i'm a dead man. rieekan a death mark's not an easy thing to live with. you're a good fighter, solo. i hate to lose you. han thank you, general. he turns to leia as rieekan moves away. han (with feeling) well, your highness, i guess this is it. leia that's right. leia is angry. han sees she has no warmth to offer him. he shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone. han (cooly) well, don't get all mushy on me. so long, princess. han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center. leia stews a moment, then hurries after him. int. hoth - rebel base - ice corridor leia han! han stops in the corridor and turns to face leia. han yes, your highnessness? leia i thought you decided to stay. han well, the bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind. leia han, we need you! han we? leia yes. han oh, what about you need? leia (mystified) i need? i don't know what you're talking about. han (shakes his head, fed up) you probably don't. leia and what precisely am i supposed to know? han come on! you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. leia yes. you're a great help to us. you're a natural leader... han no! that's not it. come on. aahhh - uh huh! come on. leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs. leia you're imagining things. han am i? then why are you following me? afraid i was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? leia i'd just as soon kiss a wookiee. han i can arrange that. you could use a good kiss! angrily, han strides down the corridor as leia stares after him. int. hoth - rebel base - another ice corridor a familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of artoo- detoo and see-threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an ice wall toward the main hangar. threepio don't try to blame me. i didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. i merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. but it's supposed to be freezing. how are we going to dry out all her clothes? i really don't know. artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles. threepio oh, switch off. int. hoth - rebel base - main hangar deck the two robots stop at han solo's space freighter. han and chewie are struggling with their central lifters. han (to chewie) why do you take this apart now? i'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. chewie grumbles in irritation. threepio excuse me, sir. han (to chewie) put them back together right now. threepio might i have a word with you, please? han what do you want? threepio well, it's princess leia, sir. she's been trying to get you on the communicator. han i turned it off. i don't want to talk to her. threepio oh. well, princess leia is wondering about master luke. he hasn't come back yet. she doesn't know where he is. han i don't know where he is. threepio nobody knows where he is. han what do you mean, "nobody knows"? han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet. threepio well, uh, you see... han jumps down off the lift, as threepio follows him. han deck officer. deck officer! threepio excuse me, sir. might i inqu... han abruptly puts his hand over threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches. deck officer yes, sir? han do you know where commander skywalker is? deck officer i haven't seen him. it's possible he came in through the south entrance. han it's possible? why don't you go find out? it's getting dark out there. deck officer yes, sir. the deck officer leaves hurriedly, as han takes his hand off threepio's mouth. threepio excuse me, sir. might i inquire what's going on? han why not? threepio impossible man. come along, artoo, let's find princess leia. between ourselves, i think master luke is in considerable danger. int. hoth - rebel base - main ice tunnel the deck officer and his assistant hurry toward han as he enters the tunnel. deck officer sir, commander skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. he might have forgotten to check in. han not likely. are the speeders ready? deck officer not yet. we're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. han then we'll have to go out on tauntauns. deck officer sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. han that's right. and my friends out in it. assistant officer i'll cover sector twelve. have com-control set screen alpha. han pushes through the troops and mounts a tauntaun. deck officer your tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. han then i'll see you in hell! han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night. ext. hoth - ice gorge - dusk the jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a hoth day. luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. one side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. he opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. as he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. he focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. just as the ice creature looms over luke, the lightsaber jumps into luke's hand. the young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice. he flops to the snow in a heap. the startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. luke scrambles to his feet. he swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain. ext. hoth - entrance to ice gorge - dusk luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight. weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank. ext. hoth - snow plain - dusk a small, lone figure riding a tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold. as it runs, the tauntaun's legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air. ext. hoth - outside ice hangar - dusk artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly. threepio moves stiffly over to him. threepio you must come along now, artoo. there's really nothing more we can do. and my joints are freezing up. artoo beeps, long and low. threepio don't say thing like that! of course we'll see master luke again. he'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) stupid little short-circuit. he'll be quite all right. threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as artoo mournfully keeps his vigil. ext. hoth - snow drift - dusk the wind is blowing quite strong now. luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. he struggles to get up, but he can't. the young warrior from tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses. int. rebel base - main hangar deck - entrance - night princess leia stands inside the dark entrance to the rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two rebel heroes. she shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, chewie sits with his head in his hands. in the background, artoo and threepio move through the doors. a rebel lieutenant moves to major derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess. lieutenant sir, all the patrols are in. there's still no contact from skywalker or solo. threepio mistress leia, artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought. derlin your highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. the shield doors must be closed. he turns to the lieutenant. derlin close the doors. lieutenant yes, sir. the lieutenant walks away. chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote. at the same moment, artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps. threepio artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one. leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave. the loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern. chewie lets out another suffering howl. threepio actually, artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. oh, dear, oh, dear. don't worry about master luke. i'm sure he'll be all right. he's quite clever, you know... for a human being. ext. hoth - snow drift - dusk luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. slowly he looks up and sees ben kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow. it is hard to tell if kenobi is real or a hallucination. ben luke... luke. luke (weakly) ben? ben you will go to the dagobah system. luke dagobah system? ben there you will learn from yoda, the jedi master who instructed me. the image of ben fades, revealing a lone tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon. luke (groaning faintly) ben... ben. luke drops into unconsciousness. han pulls up and leaps off his mount. he hurries to his snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms. han's tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow. but han's concern is with luke, and he shakes him urgently. han luke! luke! don't do this, luke. come on, give me a sign here. luke doesn't respond. han begins frantically rubbing and slapping luke's unconscious face. as he starts to lift the youth, han hears a rasping sound behind him. he turns, just in time to see his tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow. han carries luke to the moaning beast. then, with a final groan, the tauntaun expires. han not much time. he pushes luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast. luke (moaning) ben... ben... han hang on, kid. luke dagobah system... han ignites luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe. he quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass. han (reeling from the odor) whew... luke dagobah... han this may smell bad, kid... luke (moaning) yoda... han ...but it will keep you warm... til i get the shelter built. (struggling to get luke inside the carcass) ooh... i thought they smelled bad on the outside! the wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move. han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container. he begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter hoth night. ext. hoth - snowdrift - dawn four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape. int. snowspeeder cockpit there is only one pilot, zev, in the enclosed two-man craft. he concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit. he hears a low beep from one of his monitors. zev (into transmitter) echo base... i've got something! not much, but it could be a life form. ext. hoth - snowdrift the small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction. int. snowspeeder - cockpit the pilot switches over to a new transmitter. zev (into transmitter) this is rogue two. this is rogue two. captain solo, so you copy? commander skywalker, do you copy? this is rogue two. there is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice. han (filtered over zev's receiver) good morning. nice of you guys to drop by. zev (switching transmitters) echo base... this is rogue two. i found them. repeat, i found them. ext. hoth - snowdrift - day the small shelter han set up is covered with snow on the windward side. a makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift. han spots zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft. int. rebel base - medical center strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment. a switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime. he begins to thrash about, raving in delirium. int. rebel base - medical center - recovery room luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling. his face shows terrible wounds from the wampa's attack. threepio and artoo enter the room. threepio master luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. artoo beeps his good wishes. threepio artoo expresses his relief, also. han and chewie make their entrance. the wookiee growls a greeting. han how are you feeling, kid? you don't look so bad to me. in fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark. luke thanks to you. han that's two you owe me, junior. han turns as leia enters the room. he looks at her with a big, devilish grin. han well your worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. leia (haughtily) i had nothing to do with it. general rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. han that's a good story. i think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. leia i don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain. chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. han, enjoying himself, regards chewie good-humoredly. han laugh it up, fuzzball. but you didn't see us alone in the south passage. luke sparks to this; he looks at leia. han she expressed her true feelings for me. leia is flushed, eyes darting between luke and han. leia my...! why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder! han who's scruffy-looking? (to luke) i must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she focuses on luke. leia why, i guess you don't know everything about women yet? with that she leans over and kisses luke on the lips. then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck. with some smugness, luke puts his hands behind his head and grins. suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard. announcer (over loudspeaker) headquarters personnel, report to command center. the voice repeats the order and han, chewie, artoo, and threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to luke. han take it easy. threepio excuse us, please. int. hoth - rebel base - command center rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen. he calls over to leia and han. rieekan princess... we have a visitor. the group hurries over to rieekan. rieekan we've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. senior controller it's metal. leia then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked luke. han it could be a speeder, one of ours. senior controller no. wait - there's something very weak coming through. threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal. threepio sir, i am fluent in six million forms of communication. this signal is not used by the alliance. it could be an imperial code. the transmission ends in static. han it isn't friendly, whatever it is. come on, chewie, let's check it out. rieekan send rogues ten and eleven to station three-eight. ext. hoth - snow plain - day the dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three- eight and down a ridge toward the rebel base. it raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal. the probe droid has spotted chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has popped his head over a snow bank. instantly, the probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire. but before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million pieces. han solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the imperial probe. int. hoth - rebel base - command center leia and rieekan listen to han on the comlink. han (over comlink) afraid there's not much left. leia (into comlink) what was it? han (over comlink) droid of some kind. i didn't hit it that hard. it must have had a self-destruct. leia (into comlink) an imperial probe droid. han (over comlink) it's a good bet the empire knows we're here. rieekan we'd better start the evacuation. ext. space - imperial fleet darth vader's star destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five imperial star destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space. the six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft. tie fighters dart to and fro. int. darth vader's star destroyer - bridge - main control deck controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls. the squat, evil-looking admiral ozzel and the young, powerfully built general veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it. darth vader, lord of the sith, enters like a chill wind. as vader moves across the wide bridge, captain piett hurries up to ozzel. piett admiral. ozzel yes, captain piett i think we've got something, sir. the report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. ozzel (irritated) we have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. i want proof, not leads! piett the visuals indicate life readings. ozzel it could mean anything. if we followed every lead... piett but, sir, the hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the rebel snow base. rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance. vader you found something? piett yes, my lord. vader (studying the image on the console screen) that's it. the rebels are there. ozzel my lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. it could be smugglers, it could be... vader that is the system. and i'm sure skywalker is with them. set your course for the hoth system. general veers, prepare you men. int. hoth - rebel base - transport bay a captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the main transport bay. several rebel transports behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in panic. rebel captain groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. as soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. rebel fighter right, sir. int. hoth - rebel base - main hangar deck alarms sound. troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert stations. armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near the main entrance. in the midst of all this activity, han does some frantic welding on the lifters of the millennium falcon. han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor. he pulls out his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters. han (into comlink, to chewie) okay, that's it. try it... off! turn it off! turn it off! off! smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter. exasperated, han surveys the new damage. int. rebel base - medical center luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by. medical droid sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the t-forty- sevens. luke well, forget the heavy equipment. there's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. medical droid take care, sir. luke thanks. int. rebel base - main hangar deck pilots, gunners, and r2 units scurry about. luke, pulling on his heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders. he stops at the rear of the millennium falcon, where han and chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before. luke chewie, take care of yourself, okay? as luke pats chewie on the arm, chewie puts his arms around luke and gives him a tight hug. han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees luke. han hi, kid. (to droid) there's got to be a reason for it. check it at the other end. wait a second. (to luke) you all right? luke yeah. han be careful. luke you, too. luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on. after a few steps, he stops and looks back. han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, all difficult to verbalize. int. rebel base - control room. alarms sound throughout the hidden rebel base. in the control room, a controller urgently gestures for general rieekan to check a computer scan. controller general, there's a fleet of star destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four. rieekan reroute all power to the energy shield. we've got to hold them till all transports are away. prepare for ground assault. rieekan exits hurriedly. int. vader's star destroyer - vader's chamber - meditation cubicle the dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls on the brooding dark lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube. general veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving vader. although seemingly very sure of himself, veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord. the younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks. vader what is it, general? veers my lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. com-scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the hoth system. the field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. vader (angrily) the rebels are alerted to our presence. admiral ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. veers he felt surprise was wiser... vader he is as clumsy as he is stupid. general, prepare your troops for a surface attack. veers yes, my lord. veers turns smartly and leaves as vader activates a large viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship. admiral ozzel appears on the viewscreen, standing slightly in front of captain piett. ozzel lord vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to... aaagh! vader you have failed me for the last time, admiral. captain piett. piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully. piett yes, my lord. vader make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. you are in command now, admiral piett. piett thank you, lord vader. piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed emotion. he glances warily at the struggling admiral ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him. int. rebel base - main hangar deck with a sense of urgency, leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered in the center of the hangar. leia all troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. the heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. only two fighter escorts per ship. the energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. hobbie two fighters against a star destroyer? leia the ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. when you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. understood? pilots (in unison) right. okay. leia good luck. derlin okay. everyone to your stations. let's go! the pilots hurry away. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench - day rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along the snow trench. men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold wind. other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into position. ext. hoth - ice plain - power generators near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy battle equipment. buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking fingers of energy into the bitter hoth wind. int. rebel base - command center the long line of rebel controllers is tense, as are princess leia and general rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear. rieekan their primary target will be the power generators. prepare to open the shield. ext. ice plain the rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from the ice planet. ext. space - imperial star destroyer a huge imperial star destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above the white surface of the planet hoth. int. imperial star destroyer - bridge an imperial controller approaches his commander. controller sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector. captain good. our first catch of the day. int. rebel base - command center woman controller stand by, ion control... fire! ext. rebel base ice cave - ion cannon the giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two red energy beams skyward. ext. space - hoth - rebel transport the rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, closely followed by the two red energy beams. as the rebel transport races toward the waiting imperial star destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts. the imperial star destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull. the big star destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control. as the imperial ship careers into deep space, the rebel transport races away to safety. int. rebel base - main hangar deck pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their vehicles. announcer (over loudspeaker) the first transport is away. everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar. luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder. his gunner, dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him. they climb in. dack feeling all right, sir? luke just like new, dack. how about you? dack right now i feel like i could take on the whole empire myself. luke (quietly, strapping in) i know what you mean. ext. hoth - ice plain a thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape. small dot-size objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the rebel base. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench a rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes. through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant imperial snow walker. he adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines. small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers. the officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate. the pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling. the officer speaks into his comlink. trench officer echo station three-t-eight. int. rebel base - corridor pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders. ice and snow begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer. trench officer (over comlink) we have spotted imperial walkers! controller imperial walkers on the north ridge. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench the rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt all around them. they are nervous and their grip on their weapons tightens from the cold and from fear. behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) echo station five-seven. we're on our way. ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield the fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle. they accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) all right, boys, keep tight now. dack luke, i have no approach vector. i'm not set. luke steady, dack. attack pattern delta. go now! ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield the cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders. other walkers loom in the background. two speeders race away past two of the enormous walkers and bank to the right. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke all right, i'm coming in. he turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying toward its towering legs. the horizon twists as the speeder banks between the legs. luke (into comlink) hobbie, you still with me? ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly past it. three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons. ext. hoth - ice plain - snowtrench rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice explode all around them. ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield a speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker. two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction. other rebel craft race just above the icy plain. a giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames. int. imperial snow walker - cockpit general veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward. luke's speeder banks in from the side of veers's walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away. an explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm. the speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance. luke that armor's too strong for blasters. on the horizon, another walker moves up past luke's cockpit window, twisting out of sight as luke banks and starts another run. luke (into comlink) rogue group, use your harpoons and tow cables. go for the legs. it might be our only chance of stopping them. (to dack) all right, stand by, dack. dack is at the gunner's controls. dack luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. i'll have to cut in the auxiliary. luke just hang on. hang on, dack. get ready to fire that tow cable. barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, dack struggles to set up his harpoon gun. luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker. laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course for the tiny craft. ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield rogue leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the walker as explosions burst all around them. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit after sustaining a heavy volley of fire, luke turns around to see if dack is all right. luke dack? dack! dack is lost. blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his smoldering controls. out the back window, an imperial walker recedes in the distance. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench area rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around them. ext. hoth - ice plain - battlefield two walkers lumber toward the rebel base as a speeder between them explodes in a ball of flames. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench the dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes. int. imperial snow walker - cockpit through the cockpit window, veers and his pilot can see the rebel power generators in the distance. a hologram of darth vader appears on a control panel screen. veers yes, lord vader. i've reached the main power generator. the shield will be down in moments. you may start your landing. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) rogue three. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit wedge (into comlink) copy, rogue leader luke (over comlink) wedge, i've lost my gunner. you'll have to make this shot. i'll cover for you. set your harpoon. follow me on the next pass. wedge (into comlink) coming around, rogue leader. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) steady, rogue two ext. hoth - battlefield wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit wedge (to gunner) activate harpoon. wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon. the harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the walker. ext. hoth - battlefield the harpoon hurtles toward the walker, in an instant it is embedded in one of the walker's legs. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit wedge (to gunner) good shot, janson. ext. hoth - battlefield the speeder rogue three races around one of the giant walker's feet, trailing the cable behind it. continuing around the back foot, rogue three then circles the walker around the tail end. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker. wedge one more pass. janson coming around. once more. ext. hoth - battlefield the speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the cable behind it. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit janson once more. wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker. janson cable out! let her go! wedge detach cable. ext. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three the cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable drops away. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit janson cable detached. ext. hoth - battlefield the speeder zooms away into the distance. the tangled legs of the enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant imperial walker begins to topple. it teeters for a moment, and then crashes onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying. ext. hoth - ice plain - snow trench the troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker. an officer gives a signal to his men and rebel troops charge the fallen war machine. trench officer come on! the troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two rebel speeders flying overhead. just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground. int. wedge's snowspeeder, rogue three - cockpit wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the fallen walker. wedge (into comlink) whooha! that got him! int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) i see it, wedge. good work. int. rebel base - command center large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as leia and general rieekan monitor computer screens. rieekan i don't think we can protect two transports at a time. leia it's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. we have no choice. rieekan (into comlink) launch patrols. leia (to an aide) evacuate remaining ground staff. int. rebel base - main hangar muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of the hangar. trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, han works on one of the falcon's lifters while chewie works on one of the wings. noticing chewie attach a wrong part, han grows impatient. han no, no! no! this one goes there, that one goes there. right? in another area of the hangar, threepio watches as artoo is raised up into luke's x-wing fighter. threepio artoo, you take good care of master luke now, understand? and ... do take good care of yourself. oh, dear, oh, dear. ext. hoth - battlefield the fierce battle on the vast snow plains of hoth rages on. the imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the rebel base, firing lasers as they lumber ever onward. in the snow trench, rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them. a gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes. another blast destroys a ray gun. int. imperial snow walker - cockpit general veers studies various readouts on his control panel. veers all troops will debark for ground assault. prepare to target the main generator. ext. hoth - battlefield luke's speeder and rogue two fly in formation, banking from right to left and flying above the erupting battlefield. flak bursts all around them. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke, glancing over, sees rogue two on his left. his ship shudders as flak bursts nearby. luke (into comlink) rogue two, are you all right? int. zev's snowspeeder, rogue two - cockpit zev (into comlink) yeah. i'm with you, rogue leader. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) we'll set harpoon. i'll cover for you. ext. hoth - battlefield the two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers. int. zev's snowspeeder, rogue two - cockpit zev (into comlink) coming around. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit luke (into comlink) watch that cross fire, boys. int. zev's snowspeeder, rogue two - cockpit zev (into comlink) set for position three. (to gunner) steady. luke (over comlink) stay tight and low. ext. zev's snowspeeder, rogue two luke's speeder moves in formation with rogue two, when suddenly zev's speeder is hit by a laser bolt. his ship bucks violently under the impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame. spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker. before they collide. rogue two explodes in a million flaming pieces. int. luke's snowspeeder, rogue leader - cockpit desperately, luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship. suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion. luke struggles with the controls with a look of terror on his face. the speeder fills with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit. luke (into comlink) hobbie, i've been hit! int. rebel base - command center apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is strangely quiet and empty. running footsteps echo through the freezing hallway, then han appears. cracks have appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways. han hurries into the command center. it is a shambles, but some people are still at their posts. as he enters, a gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room. he finds leia and threepio near one of the control boards. han you all right? leia nods. she is surprised to see him. leia why are you still here? han i heard the command center had been hit. leia you got your clearance to leave. han don't worry. i'll leave. first i'm going to get you to your ship. threepio your highness, we must take this last transport. it's our only hope. leia (to controller) send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. a blast rocks the command center, throwing threepio backward into han's arms. announcer (over loudspeaker) imperial troops have entered the base. han come on... that's it. leia (to head controller) give the evacuation code signal. and get to your transports! leia looks exhausted. han grabs her and starts to lead her out. as han, leia, and threepio run out of the command center, the code signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls. head controller k-one-zero... all troops disengage. threepio (to han and leia) oh! wait for me! ext. battlefield - snow trench rebel troops retreat under the awesome imperial onslaught. officer begin retreat! second officer fall back! troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them. ext. hoth - battlefield three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the rebel headquarters. ext. hoth - snow trench continuing their retreat, the rebels see the walkers looming ever nearer. ext. hoth - battlefield - ice plain on the battlefield, luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over him. he looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing overhead. running beneath the monstrous machine, luke fires his harpoon gun at the walker's underside. a thin cable follows the projectile from the gun. the magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull. still running under the walker, luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle. soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker. the walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow. stray laser bolts whistle by luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch. hanging precariously, luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword. he takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the imperial machine. quickly, luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below. he lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him. the giant walker stops in mid-step. a muffled explosion comes from within - and then the walker's mechanical insides are spewed out every conceivable opening. the machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like a locomotive on stilts. ext. hoth - battlefield veers's walker continues to advance toward the rebel base. the smoldering walker that luke exploded stands smoking just to the right of veers's path. int. imperial snow walker - cockpit inside his walker, general veers prepares to fire on the rebel power generators. veers distance to power generators? pilot one-seven, decimal two-eight. veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main generator. veers target. maximum fire power. ext. hoth - battlefield the rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the relentless imperial assault. int. hoth - rebel base - ice corridors with threepio lagging behind, han and leia race through the crumbling ice corridors. suddenly, there is an explosion. han turns, grabs the princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks their path. he takes the comlink from his pocket. han (into comlink) transport, this is solo. better take off - i can't get to you. i'll get the princess out on the falcon. han and leia turn and race down the corridor. threepio but... but... but... where are you going? uh... come back!! int. hoth - rebel base - command center imperial troops have reached the base. as they push through the blocked passageway, darth vader strides behind them. int. hoth - rebel base - ice corridor han and leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the millennium falcon is docked. threepio still lags behind. threepio wait! wait for me! wait! stop! the door to the hangar closes in his face. threepio (exasperated) how typical. quickly, the door reopens as han reaches out and pulls the golden droid through. han come on. int. hoth - rebel base - main hangar chewie paces under the shelter of the millennium falcon's landing gear. the giant wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words. as he searches worriedly for his captain, something at last catches his eye. chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing han and leia running toward the ship. the wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, then runs up the ship's ramp. han and leia run up the ramp after him, closely followed by threepio. han hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! threepio wait! wait! int. hoth - rebel base - ice corridor imperial troops run through the base corridors. vader surveys the place. a huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but he calmly, purposefully, continues around it. int. rebel base - main hanger - millennium falcon a distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck. ice cakes come crashing down on the millennium falcon. int. main hangar - millennium falcon - main hold han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as chewie watches a troublesome gauge. a worried leia observes their efforts. han (to chewie) how's this? the wookiee barks a negative reply. leia would it helped if i got out and pushed? han it might. threepio clanks into the hold. threepio captain solo, captain solo... sir, might i suggest that you... han gives the gold robot a devastating look. threepio it can wait. int. main hangar - millennium falcon - cockpit they move to the cockpit where han flips some more switches. leia watches him, impatient, disbelieving. leia this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. han this baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart. han and leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar. quickly, han straps himself into the pilot's seat and leia into the navigator's chair. int. hoth - rebel base - main hangar stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon. behind them the giant hangar doors open slowly. ext. main hangar - millennium falcon a laser gun appears on the falcon and swings around to aim at the imperial troops. the stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by the falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions. int. main hangar - millennium falcon - cockpit chewie rushes into the cockpit. han come on! come on! switch over. let's hope we don't have a burnout. a laser hits the window near chewie as he is settling into his chair. letting out a loud whelp, chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and the first stage of engine fire can be heard. han flashes a big grin at leia. han see? leia someday you're going to be wrong, and i hope i'm there to see it. han looks at chewie. han punch it! the roar of the falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice- cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window. int. rebel base - main hangar more stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by vader. hearing the loud roar of the millennium falcon's engines, vader looks toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the falcon lift up and disappear outside the cave. ext. hoth - ice slope - day luke and two other pilots look up as the millennium falcon races above them, flying very close to the ground. the three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their x-wing fighters, each going to his own ship. luke waves farewell, then heads toward his own fighter. artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as luke climbs aboard the spacecraft. luke artoo! get her ready for takeoff. from his ship, luke sees wedge in his own x-wing, preparing for takeoff. wedge good luck, luke. see you at the rendezvous. luke smiles and nods at wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of his x-wing while artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently. luke don't worry, artoo. we're going, we're going. the canopy over the x-wing lowers and snaps shut. ext. space - luke's x-wing luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet. soon it disappears into the stars. int. luke's x-wing - cockpit luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision. he flips several switches. the stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn. the x-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction. the monitor screen on luke's control panel prints out a question from the concerned artoo. luke (into comlink) there's nothing wrong, artoo. i'm just setting a new course. artoo beeps once again. luke (into comlink) we're not going to regroup with the others. artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "what?!" luke reads artoo's exclamation on his control panel. luke (into comlink) we're going to the dagobah system. luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments. he rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence. finally, artoo chirps up. luke (into comlink) yes, artoo? artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles. luke (into comlink, chuckling) that's all right. i'd like to keep it on manual control for a while. the little droid lets out a defeated whimper. luke smiles, and continues on his course. ext. space - millennium falcon the millennium falcon speeds away from hoth, closely followed by one huge star destroyer and four tiny tie fighters. as it is pursued, the falcon races toward two very bright star-sized objects. int. millennium falcon - cockpit inside the cockpit, chewie lets out a loud howl. han checks as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak. he appears to be doing six things at once. han (harried) i saw them! i saw them! leia saw what? han star destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit. threepio sir, sir! might i suggest... han (to leia) shut him up or shut him down! (to chewie) check the deflector shield! chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch. han oh, great. well, we can still outmaneuver them. ext. space - millennium falcon - star destroyers the millennium falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming star destroyers. suddenly, the falcon starts into a deep dive straight down, closely followed by four tie fighters. the underside of the star destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming star destroyers. slowly, it starts to veer to the left. int. star destroyer - bridge out the front window, the two approaching star destroyers can be seen veering to the left. imperial officer take evasive action! alarms sound all over the huge ship. the two other star destroyers get closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes brushing contact with it. ext. space - millennium falcon - tie fighters the millennium falcon races away from the colliding star destroyers, still followed by four tie fighters. laser bolts spark the pitch-black skies. int. millennium falcon - cockpit things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet. chewie barks at han. leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive. the ship is buffeted by laser blasts. han prepare to make the jump to light- speed. threepio but, sir! the buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger. leia they're getting closer! han (with a gleam in his eye) oh yeah? watch this. expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there. han and chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern. leia watch what? han tries again. still nothing. han i think we're in trouble. threepio if i may say so, sir, i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. it's impossible to go to light-speed! han we're in trouble! the explosions become heavier. ext. space - millennium falcon - tie fighters - star destroyer the falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four imperial tie fighters and an imperial star destroyer. int. millennium falcon - cockpit stars race by as flak bursts outside the falcon's window. int. millennium falcon - hold han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders to chewie. han horizontal boosters...! (chewie barks) alluvial dampers...! well that's not it. (chewie barks) bring me the hydrospanners! chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge. han i don't know how we're going to get out of this one. suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the falcon, causing it to lurch radically. chewie barks. the tools fall into the pit on top of han. han oww! chewie! more turbulence rocks the ship. han that was no laser blast! something hit us. leia (over comlink) han, get up here! han come on, chewie! han climbs out of the hold like a shot. both he and chewie run out of the hold and toward the cockpit. int. millennium falcon - cockpit out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by. leia asteroids! han changes places with leia who has been at the controls, and chewie gets into his chair. han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship. han oh, no! chewie, set two-seven- one. leia what are you doing? you're not actually going into an asteroid field? han they'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? another asteroid thumps against the ship and leia winces at the jolt. leia you don't have to do this to impress me. threepio sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. han never tell me the odds! ext. asteroid belt - millennium falcon the falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows. a large asteroid tumbles away from the falcon's path at top speed. several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface. other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding. the tiny millennium falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four tie fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids. one of the pursuing tie fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes. the other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions. two huge asteroids tumble toward the millennium falcon, which quickly banks around both of them. the three tie fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space. ext. space - star destroyer - asteroid belt the massive star destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the falcon. smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface. ext. millennium falcon - tie fighters - asteroid belt the falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid. two tie fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side. int. millennium falcon - cockpit asteroids race by the cockpit window as han pilots his trusty craft through the dangerous field. looking out the cockpit window, the falcon crew sees a big asteroid drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship. chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially close - to close - and bounces off the falcon with a loud crunch. threepio's hands cover his eyes. he manages a short peek at the cockpit window. princess leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action. han gives her a quick look. han you said you wanted to be around when i made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart. leia i take it back. we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. the group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window. han i'm not going to argue with that. threepio pulverized? han i'm going in closer to one of those big ones. leia closer? threepio closer?! chewbacca barks the same word, only louder. ext. millennium falcon - asteroid belt the millennium falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized asteroids. there is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock. the two remaining tie fighters follow the falcon to the large asteroid. the falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship. the tie fighters approach the falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path. as the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded tie fighters to tumble into deep space. int. millennium falcon - cockpit rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, threepio is nearly in hysterics. threepio oh, this is suicide! han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful wookiee, pointing. han there. that looks pretty good. leia what looks pretty good? han yeah. that'll do nicely. threepio (to leia) excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater. ext. millennium falcon - giant asteroid crater the millennium falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears. int. millennium falcon - cockpit leia i hope you know what you're doing. han yeah, me too. int. giant asteroid crater the falcon races down into the crater. the walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening. a small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the falcon turns, slows, and scoots into it. ext. space - luke's x-wing the tiny x-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of dagobah. artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with some anxiety. int. luke's x-wing - cockpit luke watches artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope. luke (into comlink) yes, that's it. dagobah. artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry. luke (into comlink) no, i'm not going to change my mind about this. (getting a little nervous) i'm not picking up any cities or technology. massive life-form readings, though. there's something alive down there... artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question. luke (into comlink) yes, i'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. ext. space - dagobah - luke's x-wing the x-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud- covered planet. int. luke's x-wing - cockpit luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet. he must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision. an alarm buzzes in the background, artoo beeps and whistles frantically. luke (into comlink) i know, i know! all the scopes are dead. i can't see a thing! just hang on, i'm going to start the landing cycle... the blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out artoo's electronic squeals. suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops. luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open. ext. dagobah - dusk the mist-shrouded x-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog. luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back. the young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights. about all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby. artoo whistles anxiously. luke no, artoo, you stay put. i'll have a look around. artoo lets out a short beep. as luke moves along the nose, artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake. luke artoo? luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid. luke artoo! where are you? a small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard. the periscope starts to move to shore. relieved, luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip. luke artoo! you be more careful. the outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away. luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for artoo. the periscope still steadily moves toward shore. luke artoo - that way! suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid. the dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against artoo's metal hull. the droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream. holding his ignited lightsaber before him, luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend. luke artoo! the black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin to appear. then, phheewaat!! the runt-size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss. luke oh, no! are you all right? come on. you're lucky you don't taste very good. anything broken? luke helps artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body. artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps. luke if you're saying coming here was a bad idea, i'm beginning to agree with you. oh, artoo, what are we doing here? it's like... something out of a dream, or, i don't know. maybe i'm just going crazy. as luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports. ext. vader's star destroyer - vader's chamber admiral piett hesitates in the entryway to vader's private cubicle. after a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him. darth vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber. a black, insectlike droid attends him. among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from vader's uncovered head. the head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. the black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto vader's head. when it is in place, the dark lord turns to face piett. vader yes, admiral? piett our ships have sighted the millennium falcon, lord. but... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... vader (interrupting) asteroids do not concern me, admiral. i want that ship and not excuses. piett yes, lord. ext. asteroid cave - millennium falcon the pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave. it is so dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han and chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems. threepio and leia watch worriedly. han i'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems. threepio sir, i'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too? chewie barks "yes". but han thinks otherwise. han no, i need you to talk to the falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying. chewie howls. threepio sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. han not entirely stable? i'm glad you're here to tell us these things. chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. threepio oh! sometimes i just don't understand human behavior. after all, i'm only trying to do my job in the most... the sliding door closes behind the indignant threepio as chewie and he move back to the hold. suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing leia across the cabin into han's arms. then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started. with some surprise, han and leia realize they are in each other's arms. leia let go. han sshh! leia let go, please. leia flushes, averting her eyes. she's not exactly fighting to get free. but, of course, han blows it... han don't get excited. the anger rises in leia. leia captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. han sorry, sweetheart. we haven't got time for anything else. han grins quickly wickedly at leia as he turns and exits through the door. leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face. ext. dagobah - bog clearing - dusk the mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp. luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. he ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. taking a power cable, he plugs it into artoo's noselike socket. luke ready for some power? okay. let's see now. put that in there. there you go. the droid whistles his appreciation. luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater. luke (sighs) now all i have to do is find this yoda... if he even exists. nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle. luke still... there's something familiar about this place. i feel like... i don't know... strange voice feel like what? luke jumps out of his skin. artoo screeches in terror. the young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker. mysteriously standing right in front of luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. the wizened little thing is dressed in rags. it motions toward luke's sword. luke (looking at the creature) like we're being watched! creature away with your weapon! i mean you no harm. after some hesitation, luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why. artoo watches with interest. creature i am wondering, why are you here? luke i'm looking for someone. creature looking? found someone, you have, i would say, hmmm? the little creature laughs. luke (trying to keep from smiling) right. creature help you i can. yes, mmmm. luke i don't think so. i'm looking for a great warrior. creature ahhh! a great warrior. (laughs and shakes his head) wars not make one great. with the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies. he begins to rummage around. artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval. their tiny visitor pick up the container of food luke was eating from and takes a bite. luke put that down. hey! that's my dinner! the creature spits out the bite he has taken. he makes a face. creature how you get so big, eating food of this kind? he flips the container in luke's direction and reaches into one of luke's supply cases. luke listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... creature (teasing) aww, cannot get your ship out? the creature spots something of interest in luke's case. luke loses patience and grabs the case away. the creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight. luke hey, you could have broken this. don't do that. ohhh... you're making a mess. hey, give me that! creature (retreating with the lamp) mine! or i will help you not. clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from luke, drawing closer to artoo. as luke and the creature argue, one of artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature. luke i don't want your help. i want my lamp back. i'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. creature mudhole? slimy? my home this is. artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it. artoo beeps a few angry, "give me thats." creature ah, ah, ah! luke oh, artoo, let him have it! creature mine! mine! luke artoo! creature mine! the creature lets go with one hand and pokes artoo lightly with one finger. artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go. creature mine! luke (fed up) now will you move along, little fella? we're got a lot of work to do. creature no! no, no! stay and help you, i will. (laughs) find your friend, hmm? luke i'm not looking for a friend. i'm looking for a jedi master. creature oohhh. jedi master. yoda. you seek yoda. luke you know him? creature mmm. take you to him, i will. (laughs) yes, yes. but now, we must eat. come. good food. come. with that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily. luke stares after him. all he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog. luke makes his decision and starts after the creature. creature (in the distance) come, come. artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest. luke stay here and watch after the camp, artoo. artoo beeps even more frantically. but as luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh. int. millennium falcon - main hold area threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him. the control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps. threepio oh, where is artoo when i need him? han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box. threepio sir, i don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. i believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. i'm afraid you'll have to replace it. han well, of course i'll have to replace it. he hands a wire coil up to chewie who is working near the ceiling. han here! and chewie... chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines. han glances back at threepio, then speaks quietly to chewie so only he can hear. han (continuing) ... i think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. it doesn't budge. han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. she rebuffs him. han hey, your worship, i'm only trying to help. leia (still struggling) would you please stop calling me that? han hears a new tone in her voice. he watches her pull on the lever. han sure, leia. leia oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. han i do, i really do. you could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) come on, admit it. sometimes you think i'm all right. she lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand. leia occasionally... (a little smile, haltingly) ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. han (laughs) scoundrel? scoundrel? i like the sound of that. with that, han takes her hand and starts to massage it. leia stop that. han stop what? leia is flushes, confused. leia stop that! my hands are dirty. han my hands are dirty, too. what are you afraid of? leia (looking right into his eyes) afraid? han looks at her with a piercing look. he's never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident. he reaches out slowly and takes leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console. he draws it toward him. han you're trembling. leia i'm not trembling. then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw leia toward him... very slowly. han you like me because i'm a scoundrel. there aren't enough scoundrels in your life. leia is now very close to han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words. leia i happen to like nice men. han i'm a nice man. leia no, you're not. you're... he kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. he takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward. she has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint. when he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk. suddenly, threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly. threepio sir, sir! i've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace. han thank you. thank you very much. threepio oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir. the moment spoiled, han marches out after threepio. ext. space - asteroid field the imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently seeking its prey. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window. darth vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck. then slowly turns toward the bridge. before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. one of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static. it is the image of captain needa, commander of the star destroyer most hotly on the tail of the millennium falcon. admiral piett and an aide stand behind the dark lord. needa (in hologram) ... and that, lord vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. vader no, captain, they're alive. i want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. the imperial star captains fade out one by one as vader turns to admiral piett. piett lord vader. vader yes, admiral, what is it? the admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet. piett the emperor commands you make contact with him. vader move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. piett yes, my lord. ext. asteroid field - vader's star destroyer vader's imperial star destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet. int. vader's star destroyer - vader's chamber the dark lord, darth vader, is alone in his chamber. a strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across vader's black figure. he looks up and bows quickly. a twelve-foot hologram of the galactic emperor materializes before vader. the emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by ben kenobi. his voice is even deeper and more frightening than vader's. vader what is thy bidding, my master? emperor there is a great disturbance in the force. vader i have felt it. emperor we have a new enemy - luke skywalker. vader yes, my master. emperor he could destroy us. vader he's just a boy. obi-wan can no longer help him. emperor the force is strong with him. the son of skywalker must not become a jedi. vader if he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. emperor yes. yes. he would be a great asset. can it be done? vader he will join us or die, my master. vader kneels. the supreme emperor passes a hand over the crouched lord of the sith and fades away. ext. dagobah - creature's house - night a heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees. a strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon. the small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows. as rain tap-dances a merry tune on artoo's head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals. int. creature's house artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling. everything is in the same small scale as the creature. the only thing out of place in the miniature room is luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower. he sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room. the creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal. the stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans. the wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices. he rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of luke, who watches the creature impatiently. luke look, i'm sure it's delicious. i just don't understand why we can't see yoda now. creature patience! for the jedi it is time to eat as well. eat, eat. hot. good food, hm? good, hmm? moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot. tasting the unfamiliar concoction, he is pleasantly surprised. luke how far away is yoda? will it take us long to get there? creature not far. yoda not far. patience. soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) rootleaf, i cook. why wish you become jedi? hm? luke mostly because of my father, i guess. creature ah, your father. powerful jedi was he, powerful jedi, mmm. luke (a little angry) oh, come on. how could you know my father? you don't even know who i am. (fed up) oh, i don't know what i'm doing here. we're wasting our time. the creature turns away from luke and speaks to a third party. creature (irritated) i cannot teach him. the boy has no patience. luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces. but there is no one there. the boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is yoda, the jedi master, and that he is speaking with ben. ben's voice he will learn patience. yoda hmmm. much anger in him, like his father. ben's voice was i any different when you taught me? yoda hah. he is not ready. luke yoda! i am ready. i... ben! i can be a jedi. ben, tell him i'm ready. trying to see ben, luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling. yoda ready, are you? what know you of ready? for eight hundred years have i trained jedi. my own counsel will i keep on who is to be trained! a jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible ben, indicating luke) this one a long time have i watched. all his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. never his mind on where he was. hmm? what he was doing. hmph. adventure. heh! excitement. heh! a jedi craves not these things. (turning to luke) you are reckless! luke looks down. he knows it is true. ben's voice so was i, if you'll remember. yoda he is too old. yes, too old to begin the training. luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in yoda's voice. luke but i've learned so much. yoda turns his piercing gaze on luke, as though the jedi master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned. after a long moment, the little jedi turns toward where he alone sees ben. yoda (sighs) will he finished what he begins? luke i won't fail you - i'm not afraid. yoda (turns slowly toward him) oh, you will be. you will be. ext. space - star destroyers - asteroid field the imperial fleet around vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid storm. asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing ships. one of the smaller imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant flash of light. int. asteroid cave - millennium falcon - cockpit the cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel. princess leia sits in the pilot's seat. she runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of han and the confusion he has created within her. suddenly, something outside the cockpit window catches her eye. the reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen. leia moves closer to see what it might be. large, yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her. startled, she jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding. there is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone. the young princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit. int. asteroid cave - millennium falcon - hold area the lights go bright for a second then out again. threepio and chewbacca watch as han finishes with some wires. threepio sir, if i may venture an opinion... han i'm not really interested in your opinion, threepio. leia rushes into the cabin just as han drops the final floor panel into place. leia (out of breath) there's something out there. han where? leia outside, in the cave. as she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull. chewie looks up and barks anxiously. threepio there it is. listen! listen! han i'm going out there. leia are you crazy?! han i just got this bucket back together. i'm not going to let something tear it apart. he and chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out. leia follows. leia then i'm going with you. threepio i think it might be better if i stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) oh, no. ext. asteroid cave - millennium falcon it is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship. leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave. leia this ground sure feels strange. it doesn't feel like rock at all. han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave. han there's an awful lot of moisture in here. leia i don't know. i have a bad feeling about this. han yeah. chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit. a five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the falcon. the leathery creature lets out a screech as han blasts it with a laser bolt. han (to leia) watch out! the black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess. han bends down to investigate the dead creature. han yeah, that's what i thought. mynock. chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. they're chewing on the power cables. leia mynocks? han go on inside. we'll clean them off if there are any more. just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship. chewie shoos another mynock away with his blaster. several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the falcon. inside, threepio shudders at their presence. threepio ohhh! go away! go away! beastly little thing. shoo! shoo! han looks around the strange, dripping cave. han wait a minute... he unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. the cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle. chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by leia and han. the large wings of the mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform. int. asteroid cave - millennium falcon - entry area as soon as han and leia are on board, chewie closes the main hatch. the ship continues to shake and heave. han all right, chewie, let's get out of here! the wookiee heads for the cockpit as han, followed by threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel. leia hurries after. leia the empire is still out there. i don't think it's wise to... han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit. han (interrupting) no time to discuss this in committee. and with that he is gone. the main engines of the falcon begin to whine. leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship. leia (angry) i am not a committee! int. asteroid cave - millennium falcon - cockpit han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle. the cave-quake has greatly diminished. leia you can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field... han sit down, sweetheart. we're taking off! as the ship begins to move forward, chewie barks. he notices something out the window ahead. threepio sees it too. threepio look! han i see it, i see it. suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance. and as the falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward. threepio we're doomed! leia the cave is collapsing. han this is no cave. leia what? leia's mouth drops open . she sees that the rocks of the cave entrance are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny ship. chewie howls. int. space slug mouth the millennium falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed. ext. cave entrance - giant asteroid the enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the falcon flies out of its mouth. the monster tilts its head, watching the starship fly away. ext. millennium falcon - giant asteroid the falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of the asteroid storm. ext. dagobah - day with yoda strapped to his back, luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp. panting heavily, he continues his course - climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog. yoda run! yes. a jedi's strength flows from the force. but beware of the dark side. anger... fear... aggression. the dark side of the force are they. easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. if once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did obi-wan's apprentice. luke vader. is the dark side stronger? yoda no... no... no. quicker, easier, more seductive. luke but how am i to know the good side from the bad? yoda you will know. when you are calm, at peace. passive. a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. luke but tell me why i can't... yoda (interrupting) no, no, there is no why. nothing more will i teach you today. clear your mind of questions. mmm. mmmmmmmm. artoo beeps in the distance as luke lets yoda down to the ground. breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on. he turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water. giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side. luke stares at the tree, trembling. luke there's something not right here. yoda sits on a large root, poking his gimer stick into the dirt. luke i feel cold, death. yoda that place... is strong with the dark side of the force. a domain of evil it is. in you must go. luke what's in there? yoda only what you take with you. luke looks warily between the tree and yoda. he starts to strap on his weapon belt. yoda your weapons... you will not need them. luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no." yoda shrugs. luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree. int. dagobah - tree cave luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave. the youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave. the space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. his sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. it is very quiet here. then, a loud hiss! darth vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword. immediately, he charges luke, saber held high. he is upon the youth in seconds, but luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at vader with his sword. vader is decapitated. his helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. the metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. for an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically. the black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... luke's head. across the space, the standing luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror. the decapitated head fades away, as in a vision. ext. dagobah - cave - dusk meanwhile, yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his gimer stick. ext. space - vader's star destroyer vader's imperial star destroyer moves through space, guarded by its convoy of tie fighters. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge - control deck vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a motley group of men and creatures. admiral piett and two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn. piett bounty hunters. we don't need that scum. first controller yes, sir. piett those rebels won't escape us. a second controller interrupts. second controller sir, we have a priority signal from the star destroyer avenger. piett right. the group standing before vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters there is bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; zuckuss and dengar, two battle- scarred, mangy human types; ig-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and boba fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit. vader ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the millennium falcon. you are free to use any methods necessary, but i want them alive. no disintegrations. boba fett as you wish. at that moment, admiral piett approaches vader in a rush of excitement. piett lord vader! my lord, we have them. ext. imperial star destroyer, avenger - asteroid belt the millennium falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a firing imperial star destroyer. a large asteroid about the same size as the falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship. the tiny falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface. then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast star destroyer. int. millennium falcon - cockpit the ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window. threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while leia watches tensely out the window. threepio oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside. a bolt from the star destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the falcon, causing it to lurch to one side. ext. millennium falcon - star destroyer, avenger - asteroid field the falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the star destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship. the falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself. int. millennium falcon - cockpit han corrects the angle of his ship. han let's get out of here. ready for light-speed? one... two... three! han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens. flak bursts continue to rock the ship. han (frantic) it's not fair! chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain. again, han desperately pulls back on the throttle. han the transfer circuits are working. it's not my fault! chewie puts his head in his hands, whining. leia (almost expecting it) no light-speed? han it's not my fault. threepio sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. one more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever. han turn her around. chewie barks in puzzlement. han i said turn her around! i'm going to put all power in the front shield. leia you're going to attack them?! threepio sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer... leia shut up! ext. space - millennium falcon - asteroid field the falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. in the next moment it is racing toward the star destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the imperial ship. as it moves across the surface of the star destroyer, the falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts. int. star destroyer, avenger - bridge the tiny falcon heads directly for the avenger's bridge. the imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area. alarms go off everywhere. the destroyer's commander, captain needa, can scarcely believe his eyes. needa they're moving to attack position! shields up! needa and his men duck as the falcon nears the bridge window. at the last minute, the falcon veers off and out of sight. all is quiet. needa track them. they may come around for another pass. tracking officer captain needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. needa they can't have disappeared. no ship that small has a cloaking device. tracking officer well, there's no trace of them, sir. communications officer captain, lord vader demands an update on the pursuit. needa (drawing a breath) get a shuttle ready. i shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to lord vader. meanwhile, continue to scan the area. communications officer yes, captain needa. ext. dagobah - bog - day luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain. he stands on his hands, with yoda perched on his feet. opposite luke and yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls. luke stares at the rocks and concentrates. one of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to rest on the other. yoda use the force. yes... yoda taps luke's leg. quickly, luke lifts one hand from the ground. his body wavers, but he maintains his balance. artoo, standing nearby, is whistling and beeping frantically. yoda now... the stone. feel it. luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock. it rises a few feet, shaking under the strain. but, distracted by artoo's frantic beeping, luke loses his balance and finally collapses. yoda jumps clear. yoda concentrate! annoyed at the disturbance, luke looks over at artoo, who is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him. artoo waddles closer to luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the edge of the swamp. catching on, luke rushes to the water's edge. the x-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the lake's surface. luke oh, no. we'll never get it out now. yoda stamps his foot in irritation. yoda so certain are you. always with you it cannot be done. hear you nothing that i say? luke looks uncertainly out at the ship. luke master, moving stones around is one thing. this is totally different. yoda no! no different! only different in your mind. you must unlearn what you have learned. luke (focusing, quietly) all right, i'll give it a try. yoda no! try not. do. or do not. there is no try. luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out. slowly, the x-wing's nose begins to rise above the water. it hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again. luke (panting heavily) i can't. it's too big. yoda size matters not. look at me. judge me by my size, do you? hm? mmmm. luke shakes his head. yoda and well you should not. for my ally in the force. and a powerful ally it is. life creates it, makes it grow. its energy surrounds us and binds us. luminous beings are we... (yoda pinches luke's shoulder) ... not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) you must feel the force around you. (gesturing) here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! yes, even between this land and that ship! luke (discouraged) you want the impossible. quietly yoda turns toward the x-wing fighter. with his eyes closed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship. soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as artoo beeps in terror and scoots away. the entire x-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore. yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the beach. luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore. he walks toward yoda. luke i don't... i don't believe it. yoda that is why you fail. luke shakes his head, bewildered. ext. space - imperial fleet the fleet around vader's star destroyer now includes needa's star destroyer, the avenger. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge vader apology accepted, captain needa. clutching desperately at his throat, captain needa slumps down, then falls over on his back, at the feet of darth vader. two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as admiral piett and two of his captains hurry up to the dark lord. piett lord vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. if the millennium falcon went into light- speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. vader alert all commands. calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. piett yes, my lord. we'll find them. vader don't fail me again, admiral. vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than when he arrived. piett alert all commands. deploy the fleet. ext. space - imperial fleet vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships. the avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction. no one on that ship or on vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the avenger, is the pirateship, the millennium falcon. int. millennium falcon - cockpit threepio captain solo, this time you have gone too far. (chewie growls) no, i will not be quiet, chewbacca. why doesn't anyone listen to me? han (to chewie) the fleet is beginning to break up. go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin. threepio i really don't see how that is going to help. surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. the empire may be gracious enough... leia reaches over and shuts off threepio, mid-sentence. han thank you. leia what did you have in mind for your next move? han well, if they follow standard imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. leia with the rest of the garbage. then what? han then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. got any ideas? leia no. where are we? han the anoat system. leia anoat system. there's not much there. han no. well, wait. this is interesting. lando. he points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel. leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot. small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen. leia lando system? han lando's not a system, he's a man. lando calrissian. he's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. you'd like him. leia thanks. han bespin. it's pretty far, but i think we can make it. leia (reading from the computer) a mining colony? han yeah, a tibanna gas mine. lando conned somebody out of it. we go back a long way, lando and me. leia can you trust him? han no. but he has no love for the empire, i can tell you that. chewie barks over the intercom. han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window. han (into intercom) here we go, chewie. stand by. detach! han leans back in his chair and gives leia an invisible smile. she thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss. leia you do have your moments. not many, but you have them. ext. space - imperial star destroyer as the avenger star destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it. hidden among the refuse, the falcon tumbles away. in the next moment, the avenger roars off into hyperspace. the falcon's engines are ignited, and it races off into the distance. amidst the slowly drifting junk, boba fett's ship appears and moves after the falcon. ext. dagobah - bog - clearing - day in the clearing behind yoda's house, luke again stands upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before. yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior. on the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air. nearby artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air. his little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help. yoda concentrate... feel the force flow. yes. good. calm, yes. through the force, things you will see. other places. the future... the past. old friends long gone. luke suddenly becomes distressed. luke han! leia! the two packing boxes and artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then luke himself tumbles over. yoda (shaking his head) hmm. control, control. you must learn control. luke i saw... i saw a city in the clouds. yoda mmm. friends you have there. luke they were in pain. yoda it is the future you see. luke future? will they die? yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head. yoda difficult to see. always in motion is the future. luke i've got to go to them. yoda decide you must how to serve them best. if you leave now, help them you could. but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered. luke is stopped cold by yoda's words. gloom shrouds him as he nods his head sadly. ext. bespin system - millennium falcon - dawn the powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward the soft pink planet of bespin. ext. bespin surface - millennium falcon it is down on the gaseous planet. huge billowing clouds form a canyon as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's cloud city. suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the falcon. the cloud cars draw up alongside the starship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit one of the cloud cars opens fire on the falcon, its flak rocking the ship. chewie barks his concern. han (into transmitter) no, i don't have a landing permit. i'm trying to reach lando calrissian. more flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's interior. leia looks worried. han (into transmitter) whoa! wait a minute! let me explain. intercom voice you will not deviate from your present course. threepio rather touchy, aren't they? leia i thought you knew this person. chewie barks and growls at his boss. han (to chewie) well, that was a long time ago. i'm sure he's forgotten about that. intercom voice permission granted to land on platform three-two-seven. han (into transmitter) thank you. angry, han snaps off the intercom. chewie looks at him and grunts. han turns to the worried princess and her droid. han there's nothing to worry about. we go way back, lando and me. leia doesn't look convinced. leia who's worried? ext. cloud city - millennium falcon - cloud cars the clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out of the cloud surface. the cloud cars and the falcon head for the gleaming white metropolis. ext. cloud city - landing platform - millennium falcon with the cloud cars still guarding it, the falcon lands on one of the cloud city's platforms. ext. landing platform - door of millennium falcon han and leia stand at the open door, armed. behind them, chewie, also armed, surveys the scene warily. threepio oh. no one to meet us. leia i don't like this. han well, what would you like? threepio well, they did let us land. han look, don't worry. everything's going to be fine. trust me. int. cloud city - corridor - day lando calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a group of aides and some cloud city guard rapidly toward the landing platform. the group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions. lando has a grim expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform. ext. landing platform - door of millennium falcon han see? my friend. (to chewie) keep your eyes open, okay? chewie growls as han walks down the ramp. lando and his men head across the bridge to meet the space pirate. ext. cloud city - landing platform lando stops ten feet from han. the two men eye each other carefully. lando shakes his head. lando why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! you've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "me?" lando moves threateningly toward han. suddenly, he throws his arms around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him. lando (laughs) how you doing, you old pirate? so good to see you! i never thought i'd catch up with you again. where you been? the two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling. ext. landing platform - door of millennium falcon. threepio well, he seems very friendly. leia (wary) yes... very friendly. ext. cloud city - landing platform lando what are you doing here? han (gestures toward the falcon) ahh... repairs. i thought you could help me out. lando (in mock panic) what have you done to my ship? han your ship? hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. chewie growls a reserved greeting. lando suddenly notices the princess and smiles. lando hello. what have we here? welcome. i'm lando calrissian. i'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? leia leia. lando welcome, leia. lando bows before leia and kisses her hand. han all right, all right, you old smoothie. han takes leia by the hand and steers her away from lando. threepio hello, sir. i am see-threepio, human-cyborg relations. my facilities are at your... before threepio can finish his self-introduction, lando has turned to follow han and leia, who are walking toward the city. threepio well, really! lando, his aide, lobot, and han lead the way across the bridge, followed by threepio, chewie and leia. lando what's wrong with the falcon? han hyperdrive. lando i'll get my people to work on it. han good. lando turns to leia. lando you know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. she's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. int. cloud city - corridor the group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city. they walk down the lovely art deco passageway, rounding several corners and passing many small plazas as they go. threepio lags a bit behind. han how's the gas mine? is it paying off for you? lando oh, not as well as i'd like. we're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. and i've had supply problems of every kind. i've had labor difficulties... (catches han grinning at him) what's so funny? han you. listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. who'd have thought that, huh? lando is reflective. he looks at han a moment. lando you know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. han yeah. lando (shakes his head) yeah. i'm responsible these days. it's the price you pay for being successful. han and lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the corridor. the lagging threepio passes a threepio-type silver droid who is coming out of a door. threepio oh! nice to see a familiar face. second threepio (mumbles) e chu ta! threepio how rude! threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away. then he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an r2 unit coming from within the room. int. cloud city - anteroom curious, threepio enters the room. threepio that sounds like an r2 unit in there. i wonder if... threepio walks through the doorway to the main room. he looks in. threepio hello? how interesting. oh, my. man's voice (from within) who are you? threepio oh, i'm terribly sorry. i... i didn't mean to intrude. no, no, please don't get up. no! a laser bolt to threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions. smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door whooshes closed behind him. int. cloud city - corridor lando, han, and leia continue down the corridor unaware of threepio's dreadful accident. chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group. ext. dagobah - bog - dusk in the bright lights of the fighter, luke loads a heavy case into the belly of the ship. artoo sits on top of the x-wing, settling down into his cubbyhole. yoda stands nearby on a log. yoda luke! you must complete the training. luke i can't keep the vision out of my head. they're my friends. i've got to help them. yoda you must not go! luke but han and leia will die if i don't. ben's voice you don't know that. luke looks toward the voice in amazement. ben has materialized as a real, slightly shimmering image near yoda. the power of his presence stops luke. ben even yoda cannot see their fate. luke but i can help them! i feel the force! ben but you cannot control it. this is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force. yoda yes, yes. to obi-wan you listen. the cave. remember your failure at the cave! luke but i've learned so much since then. master yoda, i promise to return and finish what i've begun. you have my word. ben it is you and your abilities the emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. luke and that is why i have to go. ben luke, i don't want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader. luke you won't. yoda stopped they must be. on this all depends. only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor. if you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as vader did, you will become an agent of evil. ben patience. luke and sacrifice han and leia? yoda if you honor what they fight for ... yes! luke is in great anguish. he struggles with the dilemma, a battle raging in his mind. ben if you choose to face vader, you will do it alone. i cannot interfere. luke i understand. (he moves to his x-wing) artoo, fire up the converters. artoo whistles a happy reply. ben luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. luke nods and climbs into his ship. yoda strong is vader. mind what you have learned. save you it can. luke i will. and i'll return. i promise. artoo closes the cockpit. ben and yoda stand watching as the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them. yoda (sighs) told you, i did. reckless is he. now matters are worse. ben that boy is our last hope. yoda (looks up) no. there is another. ext. space - planet dagobah luke's tiny x-wing rockets away from the green planet of dagobah and off into space. int. cloud city - living quarters - day within the quarters assigned her on cloud city, leia paces in agitation. she has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress. her hair is down, tied back with ribbons. she moves from a large, open window and turns to see han entering through the doorway. han the ship is almost finished. two or three more things and we're in great shape. leia the sooner the better. something's wrong here. no one has seen or knows anything about threepio. he's been gone too long to have gotten lost. han takes leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead. han relax. i'll talk to lando and see what i can find out. leia i don't trust lando. han well, i don't trust him, either. but he is my friend. besides, we'll soon be gone. leia and then you're as good as gone, aren't you? not speaking, han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face. int. cloud city - junk room the room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts. four ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal. pieces of threepio's golden body move down the belt. chewie enters the room and spots an ugnaught picking up and inspecting threepio's head. the wookiee barks a command, startling the ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head. but the ugnaught tosses it away from him to another ugnaught. this game of keep-away goes on until threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground. int. cloud city - living quarters - day the door zaps open. chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge. leia what happened? chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation. han where? found him in a junk pile? leia oh, what a mess. chewie, do you think you can repair him? the giant wookiee studies the array of robot parts. he looks at the princess and shrugs sadly. han lando's got people who can fix him. leia no, thanks. there is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing lando. lando i'm sorry. am i interrupting anything? leia not really. lando you look absolutely beautiful. you truly belong here with us among the clouds. leia (coolly) thank you. lando will you join me for a little refreshment? han looks at lando suspiciously, but chewie barks at the mention of food and licks his lips. lando everyone's invited, of course. leia takes lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go. lando spots threepio's remains. lando having trouble with you droid? han and leia exchange a quick glance. han no. no problem. why? han and leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by lando and chewie. the door slides closed behind them. int. cloud city - corridor - day leia walks between han and lando as chewie follows a short distance behind. long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure-white columns. lando so you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the empire. leia so you're part of the mining guild then? lando no, not actually. our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. the group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end. han aren't you afraid the empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? lando that's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. but things have developed that will insure security. i've just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever. int. cloud city - dining room the mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room. at the far end of a huge banquet table sits darth vader. standing at his side and slightly behind him is boba fett, the bounty hunter. faster than the wink of an eye, han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at vader. the dark lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. just as quickly, han's weapon zips into vader's hand. the evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him. vader we would be honored if you would join us. han gives lando a mean look. lando i had no choice. they arrived right before you did. i'm sorry. han i'm sorry, too. ext. luke's x-wing - bespin system luke's x-wing races through thick clouds toward cloud city. int. luke's x-wing - cockpit luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward bespin's shining city. artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope. luke (into comlink) no, threepio's with them. artoo whistles another worried inquiry. luke (into comlink) just hang on. we're almost there. int. cloud city - large cell chewbacca is in a cloud city prison cell. the stark room is flooded with hot light. to add to chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle screeches loudly. chewie is going mad. he hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. the upper lights go off abruptly. the prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment. then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of threepio lie. he picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks. chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits. suddenly, the lights in threepio's eyes spark to life as chewie touches two connectors together. threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible. threepio mmmm. oh, my. uh, i, uh - take this off! i, uh, don't mean to intrude here. i, don't, no, no, no... please don't get up. no! chewie looks at threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head. he gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon threepio immediately begins speaking normally. threepio stormtroopers? here? we're in danger. i must tell the others. oh, no! i've been shot! int. cloud city - prison entry area darth vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism. han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device. vader activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes han's face. the door opens, and vader leaves the torture room just as han screams a sharp, piercing cry of agony. darth vader moves to the holding chamber, where lando and boba fett await him. int. cloud city - holding chamber lando lord vader. vader (to fett) you may take captain solo to jabba the hut after i have skywalker. han's screams filter through the torture room door. boba fett he's no good to me dead. vader he will not be permanently damaged. lando lord vader, what about leia and the wookiee? vader they must never again leave this city. lando that was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving han to this bounty hunter! vader perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. lando no. vader good. it would be unfortunate if i had to leave a garrison here. vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with boba fett. lando walks swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself. lando this deal's getting worse all the time. int. cloud city - large cell chewie now has a little more of threepio back together. one arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. there is one small problem, however. it seems the wookiee has managed to put the droid's head on backwards. threepio oh, yes, that's very good. i like that. oh! something's not right because now i can't see. wait. wait! oh, my! what have you done? i'm backwards, you stupid furball. only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. the wookiee smells something and sits up. the door to the chamber slides open and a ragged han solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. barking his concern, the huge wookiee gives han a big hug. han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes. han i feel terrible. chewie helps han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing leia. she, too, looks a little worse for wear. the troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. she moves to han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head. leia why are they doing this? han they never even asked me any questions. the cell door slides open. lando and two of his guards enter. leia lando. han get out of here, lando! lando shut up and listen! vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me. han over to you? lando they'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. leia what about han? lando vader's giving him to the bounty hunter. leia vader wants us all dead. lando he doesn't want you at all. he's after somebody called skywalker. han luke? lando lord vader has set a trap for him. leia's mind is racing. leia and we're the bait. lando well, he's on his way. han's rage peaks. han perfect. you fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? (spits it out) my friend! han hauls off and punches lando. the two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight. the guards hit han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room. chewie growls and starts for the guards. they point their laser weapons at the giant wookiee, but lando stops them. lando stop! i've done all i can. i'm sorry i couldn't do better, but i have my own problems. han yeah, you're a real hero. lando and the guards leave. han wipes the blood from his chin as leia and chewie help him up. leia (dabs at his wound) you certainly have a way with people. int. cloud city - carbon-freezing chamber four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks. in the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform. darth vader and lando stand near the platform. vader this facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker for his journey to the emperor. an imperial soldier appears. imperial soldier lord vader, ship approaching. x-wing class. vader good. monitor skywalker and allow him to land. the soldier bows and leaves the chamber. lando lord vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. if you put him in there, it might kill him. vader i do not want the emperor's prize damaged. we will test it... on captain solo. lando's face registers dismay. ext. space - bespin system - luke's x-wing luke's x-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city. int. luke's x-wing - cockpit encountering no city guards, luke scans the display panel with concern. int. cloud city - carbon-freezing chamber there is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform. six ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. a special coffinlike container is put in place. with boba fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in han, leia and chewie. strapped to chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is threepio. threepio's head faces the opposite direction from chewie's and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening. his one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. the remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack. threepio if only you had attached my legs, i wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. now, remember, chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. han (to lando) what's going on... buddy? lando you're being put into carbon freeze. boba fett moves away from the group to darth vader. boba fett what if he doesn't survive? he's worth a lot to me. vader the empire will compensate you if he dies. put him in! realizing what is about to happen, chewie lets out a wild howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding han. within seconds, other imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant wookiee with their laser weapons. from the instant of chewie's first move, threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm. threepio oh, no! no, no, no! stop, chewbacca, stop...! the stormtroopers are about to bash chewie in the face. han stop, chewie, stop! do you hear me? stop! threepio yes, stop, please! i'm not ready to die. han breaks away from his captors. vader nods to the guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight. han chewie! chewie, this won't help me. hey! han gives the wookiee a stern look. han save your strength. there'll be another time. the princess - you have to take care of her. you hear me? han winks at the wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell. in a flash the guards have slipped binders on chewbacca, who is too distraught to protest. han turns to princess leia. they look sorrowfully at one another, then han moves toward her and gives her a final, passionate kiss. leia i love you! han i know. tears roll down leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform. han looks one final time at his friends - and then, suddenly, the platform drops. chewie howls. leia turns away in agony. lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him. instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace. holding leia, chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving threepio a view of the procedure. threepio what... what's going on? turn round, chewbacca, i can't see. oh... they've encased him in carbonite. he should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark. a huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform. some ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform. they slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it inside. they then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away. lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. he shakes his head in relief. vader well, calrissian, did he survive? lando yes, he's alive. and in perfect hibernation. vader turns to boba fett. vader he's all yours bounty hunter. reset the chamber for skywalker. imperial officer skywalker has just landed, my lord. vader good. see to it that he finds his way here. calrissian, take the princess and the wookiee to my ship. lando you said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. vader i am altering the deal. pray i don't alter it any further. lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to leia, chewie, and threepio. int. cloud city - corridor - day as luke and artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway. artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles. luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak. boba fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of han solo. two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot luke and open fire on him. the youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. the two guards whisk han into another hallway as fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall. luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, fett, han, and the guards are gone. a think metal door blocks the passage. luke turns to see leia, chewie, threepio, and lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers. leia turns just in time to see luke. leia luke! luke, don't - it's a trap! it's a trap! before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight. luke races after the group, leaving little artoo trailing behind. int. cloud city - anteroom luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings. leia and the others are nowhere to be seen. behind luke, artoo scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes slamming down, cutting off luke's exit. several more doors clang shut, echoing through the chamber. int. cloud city - hallway leading to anteroom artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door. he whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the other direction. int. cloud city - carbon-freezing chamber - anteroom luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam. seeing an opening above him, he stops to look up. as he does, the platform he stands on begins to move. int. cloud city - carbon-freezing chamber luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform. the room is deathly quiet. very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else seems to be in the large room. warily, luke walks toward the stairway. steam begins to build up in the chamber. looking up through the steam, luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him. luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face vader. he feels confident, eager to engage his enemy. vader the force is with you, young skywalker. but you are not a jedi yet. luke ignites his sword in answer. in an instant, vader's own sword is lit. luke lunges, but vader repels the blow. again luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle. int. cloud city - corridor leia, lando, and chewie, with threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers. the group reaches an intersection where lobot and a dozen of lando's guards stand at attention. the guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers. taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, lobot hands one to leia and one to lando. lando well done. hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. move. as lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, lando begins to undo chewie's binding. leia what do you think you're doing? lando we're getting out of here. threepio i knew all along it had to be a mistake. chewie turns on lando and starts to choke him. leia do you think that after what you did to han we're going to trust you? lando tries to free himself from chewie. lando (choking) i had no choice... chewie barks ferociously. threepio (to chewie) what are you doing? trust him, trust him! leia oh, so we understand, don't we, chewie? he had no choice. lando i'm just trying to help... leia we don't need any of your help. lando (choking) h-a-a-a... leia what? threepio it sounds like han. lando there's still a chance to save han... i mean, at the east platform... leia chewie. chewie finally releases lando, who fights to get his breath back. threepio (to lando) i'm terribly sorry about all this. after all, he's only a wookiee. ext. cloud city - east landing platform - boba fett's ship the two guards slide han's encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter's ship. boba fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold. boba fett put captain solo in the cargo hold. and with that, the door slams shut. int. cloud city - corridor lando, leia, and chewie run down a cloud city corridor when suddenly they spot artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly. threepio artoo! artoo! where have you been? chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend. threepio turn around, you wooly...! (to artoo) hurry, hurry! we're trying to save han from the bounty hunter! whistling frantically to threepio, artoo scoots along with the racing group. threepio well, at least your still in one piece! look what happened to me! ext. east landing platform - side bay an elevator door slides open and lando, leia, and chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the east landing platform. just as they arrive, boba fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky. in wild anguish, chewie howls and starts firing at the ship. threepio oh, no! chewie, they're behind you! a laser bolt explodes near the princess. everyone turns to see what threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. artoo peeks out from the elevator. leia and chewbacca start firing at the troopers as lando makes a break for the elevator. laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the wookiee, but they refuse to budge. lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. they seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons. but after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator. once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward. int. cloud city - carbon-freezing chamber luke and vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber. their swords clash, the platform sways. luke aggressively drives vader back, forcing vader to use defensive tactics. vader you have learned much, young one. luke you'll find i'm full of surprises. vader makes two quick moves, hooking luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying. another lightning move at luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself. losing his balance, luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform. there he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. just in time he looks up to see vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. luke rolls away as vader lands. crouching, luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy. vader your destiny lies with me, skywalker. obi-wan knew this to be true. luke no! behind luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. all the while, luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the dark lord. suddenly, vader attacks so forcefully that luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening. there is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure vader's vision. vader turns aside and deactivates his sword. vader all to easy. perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought. through the steam behind vader something blurs upward. liquid metal begins to pour into the pit. vader turns around - and then looks up. he sees luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet. vader impressive... most impressive. luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from vader by the steaming carbonite pit. he raises his hand. his sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. vader immediately lights his sword as well. vader obi-wan has taught you well. you have controlled your fear... now release your anger. luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. he begins to retreat as vader goads him on. as luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. a quick sword exchange and luke forces vader back. another exchange and vader retreats. luke presses forward. vader only your hatred can destroy me. breathing hard, luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over vader. he lands on the floor and slashes at vader as the room continues to fill up with steam. vader retreats before luke's skillful sword. vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. the energy luke has used to stop vader has brought him to the point of collapse. luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of vader. he then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit. int. cloud city - tunnel and reactor control room moving through a tunnellike entrance, luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. he ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as vader enters. luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack. behind luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. using the force, luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield. a large pipe detaches and comes flying at luke. he deflects it. sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. small tools and equipment come flying at him. bombardment from all sides, luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. a fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of vader. a piece of machinery hits luke and he is knocked out of the window. int. gantry - outside control room - reactor shaft luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his deactivated sword in hand. he puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up. int. cloud city - corridor leading to landing platform leia, lando, chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform. they glimpse the millennium falcon for a moment before the door slams shut. the group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor. the troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group. chewie returns their fire as lando punches desperately at the door's control panel. lando the security codes has been changed! threepio artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel. artoo beeps and scoots toward it. lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's intercom. lando attention! this is lando calrissian. the empire has takes control of the city. i advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive. artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket. suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream. artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him. quickly, chewie pulls him away. lando this way. lando, leia, artoo, and chewie flee down the corridor. as he scoots along with them, artoo sends some angry beeps threepio's way. threepio don't blame me. i'm an interpreter. i'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. int. cloud city - corridor in a panic, cloud city residents are trying to get out of the city. some carry boxes, others packages. they run, then change direction. some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide. other stormtroopers pursue lando, leia, and chewie who are firing back at them. artoo works on another door to the landing platform while threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude. threepio what are you talking about? we're not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon. it's fixed! just open the door, you stupid lump. chewie, leia, and lando retreat along the corridor. a triumphant beep from artoo - and the door snaps open. threepio (to artoo) i never doubted you for a second. wonderful! artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes outside. ext. landing platform - cloud city - dusk they race for the millennium falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door. lando and leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with chewie. as chewie bounds to the ship the threepio on his back, threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp. threepio ouch! oh! ah! that hurt. bend down, you thoughtless... ow! chewie starts up the ship. the giant engines begin to whine as lando and leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire. lando leia! go! int. millennium falcon - corridor artoo drags the partially assembled threepio down the corridor of the falcon. threepio i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. of course, i've looked better. artoo beeps understandingly. int. millennium falcon - cockpit chewie works the controls as leia sits in han's seat and lando watches over their shoulders. as chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship begins to move. ext. cloud city - landing platform - dusk the millennium falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city. troops fire after it and tie fighters take off in pursuit. int. gantry - outside control room - reactor shaft luke moves along the railing and up to the control room. vader lunges at him and luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet vader's. sparks fly as they duel, vader gradually forcing luke backward toward the gantry. vader you are beaten. it is useless to resist. don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did. luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at vader so viciously that he nicks vader on the shoulder. the black armor sparks and smokes and vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers. luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as vader comes at him, slashing at the young jedi with his sword. luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward. luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. at that instant, vader's sword comes down across luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. in great pain, luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. vader follows. the wind subsides. luke holds on. there is nowhere else to go. vader there is no escape. don't make me destroy you. you do not yet realize your importance. you have only begun to discover your power. join me and i will complete your training. with our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy. luke i'll never join you! vader if you only knew the power of the dark side. obi-wan never told you what happened to your father. luke he told me enough! it was you who killed him. vader no. i am your father. shocked, luke looks at vader in utter disbelief. luke no. no. that's not true! that's impossible! vader search your feelings. you know it to be true. luke no! no! no! vader luke. you can destroy the emperor. he has foreseen this. it is your destiny. join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. come with me. it is the only way. vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to luke. a calm comes over luke, and he makes a decision. in the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. the dark lord looks over the platform and sees luke falling far below. the wind begins to blow at vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. the wind soon fades and the wounded jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall. int. reactor shaft suddenly luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft. when vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform. int. exhaust pipe luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe. he slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open. luke claws at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space. ext. bottom of cloud city - weather vane - dusk unable to hang onto the pipe, luke tumbles out, emerging at the undermost part of cloud city. reaching out desperately, he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane. luke ben... ben, please! luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down. he hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments. all the while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe. luke ben. leia! there is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below. luke hear me! leia! int. millennium falcon - cockpit leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled. chewie is busy operating the ship. lando stands next to the wookiee, watching a readout on the control panel. leia luke... we've got to go back. chewie growls in surprise. lando what? leia i know where luke is. lando but what about those fighter? chewie barks in agreement with lando. leia chewie, just do it. lando but what about vader? chewie turns on lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl. lando all right, all right, all right. ext. cloud city - millennium falcon - dusk the falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward cloud city. ext. cloud city - landing platform vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the falcon disappears. the wind blows at his cape. he turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing platform. vader bring my shuttle. ext. bottom of cloud city - weather vane nearly unconscious, luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his body shifts in the wind. ext. millennium falcon - bottom of cloud city the falcon dives to the underside of the floating city. three tie fighter close in on the starship. int. millennium falcon leia tries to remain calm. lando (pointing out the cockpit window) look, someone's up there. leia it's luke. chewie, slow down. slow down and we'll get under him. lando, open the top hatch. lando rushes out of the cockpit. ext. bottom of cloud city - weather vane luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane. he slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the falcon banks toward him. the falcon positions itself under luke as lando moves up through the opening of the hatch. luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane into space. int. millennium falcon - cockpit out the cockpit window, leia sees luke falling from the bottom of the city. the ship gains on him. leia okay. easy, chewie. the falcon closes in on luke. ext. bottom of cloud city three tie fighters race toward the falcon, firing away. int. millennium falcon - hatch the hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure. lando reaches out to help the battered warrior inside the ship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit flak bursts all around it as the falcon banks away from the city. leia and chewie struggle with the controls. leia (into intercom) lando? lando (over intercom) okay, let's go. ext. bottom of cloud city the falcon races away. it is closely followed by three tie fighters, all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship. int. millennium falcon - cockpit explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly. chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship. leia and chewie turns to see luke, bloody and battered, enter the cockpit supported by lando. leia jumps up and hugs him while chewie barks in joyous relief. luke oh, leia. lando all right, chewie. let's go. leia helps luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship. ext. space - cloud city - day the falcon, still followed by the three tie fighters, races away from the cloud-covered city. int. millennium falcon - sleeping quarters luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff. leia gently wipes his face. the ship lurches again. leia i'll be back. she kisses him, then leaves the quarters. int. millennium falcon - cockpit all over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound. lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches. seated next to him, chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel. leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the shape. leia star destroyer. lando all right, chewie. ready for light-speed. leia if your people fixed the hyperdrive. another explosion rocks the ship. leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on. leia all the coordinates are set. it's now or never. chewie barks in agreement. lando punch it! the wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle. the sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up. faces are tense, expectant. but nothing happens, and the engine goes off. chewie lets out a frustrated howl. the flak still violently rocks the ship. lando they told me they fixed it. i trusted them to fix it. it's not my fault! chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit. he gives lando and angry shove as he storms past him. ext. space in the distance the tie fighters continue their chase, still shooting lasers. vader's star destroyer moves behind them, determinedly following the falcon. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as admiral piett approaches him. piett they'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, my lord. vader did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon? piett yes, my lord. vader good. prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun. piett yes, my lord. int. millennium falcon beeping while he works, artoo is busy connecting some wires to threepio who now has one leg attached. chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself. threepio noisy brute. why don't we just go into light-speed? artoo beeps in response. threepio we can't? how would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? artoo whistles knowingly. threepio the city's central computer told you? artoo-detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. ouch! pay attention to what you're doing! chewie is in the pit. he is trying to loosen something with an enormous wrench. frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits the panel... int. millennium falcon - cockpit leia and lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly sprayed by a shower of sparks. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge vader stands on the bridge, watching as the millennium falcon is chased by the tie fighters. as his destroyer draws nearer, vader's breathing gets slightly faster. vader luke. int. millennium falcon - sleeping quarters luke realizes that vader's ship is very near. he feels resigned to his fate. he senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically. luke father. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge vader son, come with me. int. millennium falcon - sleeping quarters luke (moaning) ben, why didn't you tell me? int. millennium falcon - cockpit lando and leia are at the controls of the falcon. meanwhile, in the ship's hold, chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive mechanism. lando (into intercom) chewie! ext. space the falcon races through space followed very closely by the tie fighters and the huge imperial star destroyer. int. millennium falcon - cockpit luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window. he is almost unconscious with pain and depression. luke it's vader. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge vader luke... it is your destiny. int. millennium falcon - cockpit luke ben, why didn't you tell me? int. vader's star destroyer - bridge piett alert all commands. ready for the tractor beam. int. millennium falcon - hold artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board. furious, threepio stands on one leg, yelling. threepio artoo, come back at once! you haven't finished with me yet! you don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. chewbacca can do it. i'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! artoo moves a circuit on a control panel. suddenly, the control panel lights up. int. millennium falcon - cockpit leia and lando are thrown into their seats as the millennium falcon unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace. int. millennium falcon - hold the ship tilts up and artoo topples into the pit on top of chewie. threepio oh, you did it! ext. space the falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge star destroyer which seems, by contrast, to stand still. int. vader's star destroyer - bridge admiral piett and another captain glance at vader in terror. vader turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back in a contemplative gesture. ext. space - rebel cruiser the millennium falcon is attached to a huge rebel cruiser by a docking tube. rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a rebel transport ship hovers near the fleet. int. millennium falcon - cockpit lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink. chewie busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff. lando (into comlink) luke, we're ready for takeoff. luke (over comlink) good luck, lando lando (into comlink) when we find jabba the hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. int. star cruiser - medical center luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand. leia stands near him while threepio and artoo look out the window. luke (into comlink) i'll meet you at the rendezvous point on tatooine. int. millennium falcon - cockpit lando (into comlink) princess, we'll find han. i promise. int. star cruiser - medical center luke (into comlink) chewie, i'll be waiting for your signal. chewie's wail comes over the comlink. luke (into comlink) take care, you two. may the force be with you. luke looks down at his hand. a metalized type of bandage has been wrapped around his wrist. the medical droid makes some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of luke's fingers. luke ow! luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it. his hand is completely functional. he gets up and walks over to leia. there is a new bond between them, a new understanding. leia is thinking about han; luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated future. together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the rebel star cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space. luke puts his arm around leia. the droids stand next to them, and threepio moves closer to artoo putting his arm on him. the group watches as the millennium falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms away into space. ext. space - rebel star cruiser while luke, leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship. slowly, the cruiser turns and moves away into space. 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
luke skywalker has vanished. in his absence, the sinister first order has risen from the ashes of the empire and will not rest until skywalker, the last jedi, has been destroyed. with the support of the republic, general leia organa leads a brave resistance. she is desperate to find her brother luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to luke's whereabouts.... pan across the star field to a bright moon. a rumbling is felt. a vast star destroyer -- unlike any we have seen -- hurtles past us, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. after a long beat, four transport ships fly from a hangar. we hold on them now, as they fly off toward a distant planet. jakku. music builds and we... cut to black. a growing roar of mean engines -- gnarled radio calls, the shuddering of a ship's hull. then flashes of light: for an instant we see a stormtrooper -- then blackness. then another stormtrooper, then it's gone. the flickering continues until the lights are constant. we are in: int. troop transport vehicle - night twenty stormtroopers. holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. a filtered command and they lock and load their heavy blaster rifles. the brutal noise is replaced by sudden, shocking quiet: ext. jakku village - night wide shot of a small, peaceful village. distant sounds of native animals. a single wind chime. suddenly a droid rises into frame, close: round and skittery, orange and white, this is bb-8. focuses on something past camera. he beeps -- fast, morse code-like sounds, clearly worried. moves even closer to camera -- is more worried -- beeps more -- then turns and rolls off fast -- int. large hut - night close on a hand: a small leather sack is placed in the palm. the hand closes. another older hand covers it. in a primitive hut, an old explorer, lor san tekka, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to poe dameron (32, in a pilot's jacket). poe has charisma, a natural spark: lor san tekka this will begin to make things right. i've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. without the jedi, there can be no balance in the force. poe well, because of you now we have a chance. the general's been after this for a long time. lor san tekka "the general." to me, she's royalty. well, she certainly is that. poe bb-8 enters frantic, beeps. concerned, poe turns to lor san tekka. poe (cont'd) we've got company. ext. large hut - night the men exit fast. poe moves to camera, raises quadnoculars. poe's pov: lights on the horizon -- approaching enemy ships. poe lowers the quadnocs -- push in on his unnerved eyes. a growing, frightening thunder. poe you have to hide. lor san tekka you have to leave. go! poe turns to him. conflicted. finally nods, hurries off. bb-8 follows. ext. jakku village - night track fast with poe as he and bb-8 hurry through the village, various armed villagers taking position, prepared to defend. ext. jakku village - night a roar of wind and dust: the transports land. stormtroopers come out firing blasters -- the villagers fire back -- many are hit! ext. rise adjacent to village - night poe runs to an x-wing fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a rock outcropping. poe come on, bb-8! hurry! poe sends bb-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the controls come to life. as the canopy closes, poe shoots a quick look back: the enemy arrives in the distance. poe urgently works the controls -- bb-8 beeps. the x-wing landing lights come on, engines whine to life! but just then: poe's ship is suddenly hit by blasterfire! poe turns to look: two stormtroopers charge his way, firing! poe (cont'd) i see 'em! bb-8 beeps nervously as poe grabs his controls and fires at them, using the x-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! the two troopers are blown away in the large blast hits! poe tries to start the ship now, but the engines sputter. concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: bad damage on the rear engine panel. they're in trouble. ext. jakku village - night lor san tekka moves sadly through the village as stormtroopers wielding flame throwers destroy structures. surrendering villagers are rounded up. penned animals panic. ext. rise adjacent to the village - night back at the x-wing, poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from the leather sack a small, old artifact which he inserts into bb-8 -- the droid's multi-reader envelops it. poe you take this. it's safer with you than it is with me. you get as far away from here as you can. do you hear me? (bb-8 beeps, hesitates) i'll come back for you! it will be alright. bb-8 watches poe run off. beep-whines nervously, then turns and heads off. turns back once to look at poe, then rolls away. poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover. ext. jakku village - night the troopers and villagers in battle -- as one trooper is hit and goes down. another -- our trooper -- kneels to help. the hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his human hand visible -- and marks our stormtrooper's mask with blood just before he dies. our trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by the battle. an imposing shuttle craft -- vertical wingspan 90 feet tall -- lands near the transport vehicles. the shuttle craft door opens -- through the wind and smoke, kylo ren exits the ship: a tall, dark figure, he strides through the chaos toward san tekka. a senior trooper moves to our blood-marked trooper, and orders him: senior trooper stay here. our trooper nods. kylo ren stops before the outraged lor san tekka, dwarfing him. only now does it become apparent that kylo ren wears a dark mask, marked by battle. inset metal lines reflect fire. kylo ren look how old you've become. lor san tekka something far worse has happened to you. our blood-marked trooper is placed in line with other stormtroopers. kylo ren you know what i've come for. (continued) continued: lor san tekka i know where you come from. before you called yourself kylo ren. kylo ren the map to skywalker. we know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the first order. adjacent to the village, poe enters frame -- sees the ren/san tekka exchange continue. lor san tekka the first order rose from the dark side... you did not. kylo ren i'll show you the dark side. lor san tekka you may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. suddenly kylo ren raises his lightsaber -- ignites it -- perpendicular smaller blades at the hilt, a unique buzz -- yellow/red energy, spitting sparks and smoke -- kylo ren you're so right. and as he rips it down across san tekka! poe, running, sees this and yells, aims his blaster and fires at kylo ren! instantly: kylo ren raises his hand -- poe's blast freezes -- the bolt of energy straining and vibrating in mid air! kylo ren sees poe, who suddenly cannot move, but strains to. he is grabbed by stormtroopers who drag him past the vibrating, frozen blast, to kylo ren. a stormtrooper begins a brutal pat down. kylo ren moves closer. poe just glares. the stormtrooper kicks out poe's legs -- he lands hard on his knees. kylo ren kneels to look at poe. poe so who talks first? you talk first? kylo ren the old man gave it to you. poe (indicates kylo's mask) it's just very hard to understand you with all the... (continued) continued: kylo ren (to troopers) search him. poe ... apparatus. the troopers roughly pull poe away. a stormtrooper begins a brutal pat down. kylo ren moves closer. poe just glares as the pat down ends. stormtrooper #1 nothing, sir. kylo ren put him on board. kylo ren regards the stormtroopers with the rounded up villagers, then turns to the chrome-skinned, female black- caped head stormtrooper, captain phasma. captain phasma sir, the villagers. kylo ren kill them all. phasma nods, steps forward: captain phasma on my command! the troopers, including ours, aim at the villagers. captain phasma (cont'd) fire! poe is roughly pulled into a transport ship, the ramp lifts. all around our trooper blasterfire erupts -- but we're wide enough to see he isn't firing. push in until the firing stops. all the stormtroopers spread out to search -- except ours. kylo ren heads back toward his ship. but then he stops. feels something. turns and looks at our stormtrooper for a long moment. our trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. kylo ren then heads off -- passes the frozen blast, which, after a beat, goes free and slams into a nearby structure, scaring the hell out of our stormtrooper. ext. edge of jakku village - night a stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of poe's x-wing, backs away: (continued) continued: stormtrooper #2 nothing here. go ahead! three other stormtroopers fire laser cannons at the x-wing -- destroying the ship in a large explosion. ext. outskirts of jakku village - night bb-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the x-wing fireball. bb-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. we see a form -- an animal, its red eyes lifting from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. in a wide shot, we hear him beeping to himself, lonely and frightened. ext. space - night with the sandy planet of jakku as backdrop, troop transports and kylo ren's shuttle approach a massive star destroyer. int. star destroyer hangar - night poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. he is awed by the imposing space. poe all right. all right! our stormtrooper passes, moves fast: int. troop transport vehicle - night our stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. he removes his helmet. his head comes up and we push in on his face for the first time. this is fn-2187. he is 23, likable. but in this moment, terrified, desperate. after a beat, behind him, captain phasma enters. fn-2187 knows he's in trouble. captain phasma fn-2187. submit your blaster for inspection. fn-2187 yes, captain. captain phasma and who gave you permission to remove that helmet? fn-2187 i'm sorry, captain. captain phasma report to my division at once. (continued) continued: phasma heads off. shattered, fn-2187 replaces his helmet. cut to: int. junked vessel corridor - day a metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of a scavenger, perhaps alien, in goggles, face mask and gloves. backpack with a staff strapped to it. uses tools to remove various mechanisms from inside the wall. we are in an upside-down, canted corridor. the scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a satchel. swings the bag back and begins climbing down on a cable, between treacherous walls of machinery, headed to: int. junked vessel - larger space - later alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. lands hard onto rusty metal. int. junked vessel - engines - day the scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant slit of sunlight. ext. junked vessel engine - day the scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young woman. this is rey, 19. she opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. hits the side of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. cut wide: rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an epic engine of a decaying, crashed star destroyer -- distant sound of her canteen-hitting. she sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. she rides down the mountain of sand. we hold for a long time, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant salt flats below. random scattered debris. her speeder, tiny from here. rey moves to her junker speeder, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and drives off. ext. desert - spaceship graveyard - day rey races along the desert floor: a graveyard of crashed spaceships. ext. niima outpost - day rey's speeder passes us, heading for a dusty, desert town. refueling, small trade, scavengers. (continued) continued: crash! rey's sack carrying her heavy found objects hits the sand. working like a tough seaman, rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. ext. niima outpost - cleaning table - day tight on rey's hands as she scrubs clean her day's salvage. rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. a small, passing alien underling barks something to her in another language. she returns to work. int. niima trading structure - day rey looks up to a service window: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, unkar plutt (50, blobfish, unclean). he examines her pieces. then he offers: unkar what you've brought me today is worth... hmmm... one quarter portion. though disappointed, rey barely shows it. she nods thanks. unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a sealed packet: dried green meat in one section, beige powder in another. she takes it. she swallows her resentment and heads off. ext. niima outpost - day the immense setting sun against the flat terrain. rey's speeder races, almost insignificant, across frame. int. rey's dwelling - day she scratches marks into the rusty wall. another mark; another day. and there are thousands of marks. a sizzling sound over: a dried desert flower in a rusty engine piece. a rough, stuffed handmade doll, made from what looks like orange rebellion flight suit material and twine. rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. everything reclaimed. she cooks for one. does everything for one. she opens the powder, moves to the makeshift wok, where the green meat sizzles. pours the powder into milky water in a tin. stirs it. it grows into a loaf as she puts the meat on an old plate. grabs the loaf. ext. rey's dwelling - dusk rey sits, eats like a starving child. every last drop. licks the metal plate. looks out at the horizon. a single silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. she wipes her mouth. picks up an old, broken rebellion helmet. (continued) continued: just 'cause. puts it on, wide shot of rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of an ancient, fallen at-at in which she lives. then, a distant electronic squeal -- instantly she's up, helmet too big, she rips it off. hears another beeping squeal. she hurries to her quarterstaff and runs off. rey climbs a dune. rise with her, revealing bb-8, caught in a net but fighting back, being held by a teedo (a small, brutish desert tyrant), who rides a luggabeast. the teedo yells at bb-8, who beeps madly, struggling to free himself. rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally yelling out: rey tal'ama parqual! the teedo and bb-8 stop, go silent, turn to her. rey (cont'd) parqual zatana! a half beat and the teedo yells something back, threatening. bb-8's head swivels to him, then back to rey, like watching a tennis match. rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. rey starts cutting bb-8 out of the netting. the teedo freaks out, yelling. rey suddenly stands, turns to the teedo and says, fiercely: rey (cont'd) noma. the teedo barks a sort of "ahhhhh!" (as if to say, "go to hell!"), then heads off on his beast. this prompts bb-8 to start beep-yelling at the departing bully, provocatively. rey (cont'd) shhhh. bb-8 quiets instantly. the two watch the teedo head off. finally, bb-8 beeps a question. she kneels to him. rey (cont'd) that's just teedo. wants you for parts. he has no respect for anyone. your antenna's bent. (considers bb-8 for the first time, straightens the antenna) where do you come from? (bb-8 beeps) classified. really? me too. big secret. (points to horizon) niima outpost is that way, stay off kelvin ridge. (more) (continued) continued: rey (cont'd) keep away from the sinking fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off) bb-8 starts after her, beeps. she turns sharply, he stops. rey (cont'd) don't follow me. town is that way. (he beeps again) no! she heads off again. finally he beeps to her -- something sweet this time. that he is alone, scared, has no one else. this makes her stop. she turns and looks at him. not liking him. but a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "come on." bb-8 quickly moves to her. they head off together. rey (cont'd) in the morning, you go. (he beeps) you're welcome. the two disappear behind a dune. ext. star destroyer - day three tie fighters head to the massive ship high above jakku. int. star destroyer holding cell - day poe, shackled to a chair, beaten, wakes up. kylo ren i had no idea we had the best pilot in the resistance on board. comfortable? through battered lips: poe not really. kylo ren i'm impressed. no one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. poe might wanna rethink your technique. kylo ren says nothing, reaches out to him. poe flinches in the chair as kylo ren reaches for his face, not touching him. poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence -- kylo ren where is it? (continued) continued: poe the resistance will not be intimidated by you. kylo ren where... is it? poe can't take it -- he begins to scream and we cut to: int. star destroyer corridor - day whooosh! the cell door slides up. kylo ren exits, fierce, confronts general hux (34, scary) who awaits him: kylo ren it's in a droid. a bb unit. general hux well then. if it's on jakku, we'll soon have it. kylo ren i leave that to you. ext. niima outpost - day bb-8 is dropped to the sand. rey don't give up. he still might show up. whoever it is you're waiting for. classified. i know all about waiting. bb-8 beeptalks a question. rey (cont'd) for my family. they'll be back. one day. come on. she tries to force a smile, but can't, really. she heads off. bb-8 beeps... then heads after her. int. niima trading structure - day rey stands with bb-8 in front of unkar plutt, at his window. he reviews her goods. he glances quickly at bb-8. unkar these five pieces are worth... let me see here... one half portion. rey (objects) last week they were a half portion each. she hates him. he leans forward. (continued) continued: unkar what about the droid? rey what about him? unkar i'll pay for him. bb-8 doesn't like this at all. rey is awkward, but curious. unkar (cont'd) sixty portions. close on her. stunned. literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. bb-8 sees her interest and beeps furiously, not liking this conversation at all. she looks at unkar. looks down at bb-8. considers it all. finally, she hears herself say: rey actually... the droid's not for sale. (to bb-8) come on. unkar furious. rey, then bb-8, head out. recovering, unkar watches her go with dark eyes. he picks up a communicator: unkar follow the girl and get that droid. he slams the service window door shut. int. star destroyer holding cell - day the cell door whooshes open -- a stormtrooper enters. poe remains shackled, worse for wear. a trooper guard here. stormtrooper ren wants the prisoner. tight on poe, in pain, drained, as the guard unshackles him. int. star destroyer corridor - day an exhausted, handcuffed poe is walked down the corridor by the stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at poe's body. stormtrooper turn here. poe turns into a narrow passageway -- int. star destroyer narrow passageway - day heading down the narrow hall the stormtrooper stops poe.

general hux (with vitriol) i won't have you question my methods. kylo ren they're obviously skilled at committing high treason. perhaps leader snoke should consider using a clone army. general hux (you son-of-a-bitch) my men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- kylo ren then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. unharmed. general hux careful, ren. that your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from leader snoke. kylo ren i want that map. for your sake, i suggest you get it. ren heads off. hux hates him. ext. niima outpost - day sun-scorched and exhausted, finn stumbles out of the desert into the outpost. in a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous old ship parts, merchants, scavengers and tented stalls. finn water... water... water.. he sees a water trough where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature (a happabore) drinks. finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately drink the filthy water. after a couple swallows he spits it out, disgusted. finn (cont'd) -- awgh, gah! but he's parched and immediately returns for more. across the marketplace, rey kneels with an emphatically beeping bb-8. just then, two of unkar's thugs approach and stop her. one clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. bb-8 reacts nervously as rey resists them -- one pulls a sack over bb-8 while the other grabs rey's arm -- in the tussle, rey knocks over metal urns for sale -- finn, still drinking, is pushed over by the happabore. he falls to the ground, then turns to look when he hears crashing. he sees, through the tents, rey fighting. he moves up closer to help this young woman being accosted -- but he stops when rey begins to fight back -- scrappy and feral, she kicks, bites and hits. finn is taken aback as she defeats the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. finn just watches, stunned. rey moves to the covered bb-8 -- pulls the sack off of him. finn cannot believe his eyes. it's poe's droid! rey talks to bb-8, who, nervous now, looks around and... sees finn! bb-8 starts beeping like crazy. then something insane happens: rey looks at finn. rey (to bb-8) who? him? finn is confused. rey stands, staring at finn, defiant. finn can feel trouble coming -- and rey begins charging at him, quarterstaff in hand. realizing he's the target, finn begins to run -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then bam! she's got ahead of him and slams him to the ground with her staff! finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. she holds the staff on him threateningly: rey what's your hurry, thief? finn what--?! thief? bb-8 rolls up fast, moves to finn -- a welding arm telescopes from his body and shocks finn! finn (cont'd) ow! hey! what?! rey the jacket! this droid says you stole it! finn i've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! so i'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- ow!!! (bb-8 has zapped him again) stop it! rey where'd you get it? it belongs to his master. finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, finn's mind racing. he puts it all together. frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. so he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. finn it belonged to poe dameron. that was his name, right? rey and bb-8 react, surprised and wanting more. finn (cont'd) he was captured... by the first order! i helped him escape but our ship crashed. (reliving it) poe didn't make it. (sees bb-8 is sad, rolls off) look, i tried to help him. i'm sorry... bb-8 heads off to the side, depressed. rey watches bb-8, then considers finn again. says, a bit impressed: rey so you're with the resistance? (continued) continued: finn's mind races again. he makes an easy decision: to lie. finn obviously. yes. i am. i'm with the resistance, yeah. (whispers) i'm with the resistance. rey lowers her staff, finn stands. rey studies him: rey i've never met a resistance fighter before. finn well, this is what we look like. some of us. others look different. rey bb-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. finn apparently he's carrying a map that leads to luke skywalker, and everyone's after it. she turns to him, concerned, curious. and asks: rey luke skywalker? i thought he was a myth. just then bb-8 beeps madly at something he sees. rey (cont'd) what is it? rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. now finn moves to see: at a distance, two stormtroopers talking to unkar's thugs -- who point their way! finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: rey (cont'd) (re: her hand) what are you doing?! finn come on! suddenly laser blasts rip past them, hit the cleaning unit, spewing steam! rey screams -- more blasts as they run! ext. niima outpost - day finn and rey holding hands, the three race, zigzagging through a maze of tents: (continued) continued: finn come on, bb-8! rey let go of me! finn no, we gotta move! rey (pulls her hand back) i know how to run without you holding my hand! bb-8 stay close! this way! now finn and bb-8 follow rey -- another blast just missing them! they disappear through a tent. track fast with stormtroopers, through the tent maze. they come out of a tent, having momentarily lost their target. stormtrooper call in the air strike! rey, finn and bb-8 duck into another tent: int. niima outpost - tent - day rey, finn and bb-8 move through rusty wares and take cover. quiet, urgent: rey they're shooting at both of us! finn yeah, they saw you with me! you're marked! rey well, thanks for that! finn i'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! does anyone have blasters around here?! rey (to bb-8) are you okay? finn quiets her with a gesture, hearing something. push in on finn -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly -- he grabs her hand again -- pulls her away -- rey (cont'd) stop taking my hand! ext. niima outpost - tent - day finn pulls rey from the tent -- bb-8 follows -- as they race from the tent a tie fighter screams into view from behind the tents! a second follows close behind. it fires at them -- a massive blast sends rey and finn flying -- bb-8 rolling! wide shot: two tie fighters scream over the town, the explosion throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air. rey is thrown hard to the ground -- she is rattled, truly afraid. then she turns: finn lies nearby, unconscious. suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. bb-8 rolls over, beeping in concern. rey hey! as finn comes to, he sees her. through his fog: finn -- are you okay? and that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it. rey yeah. (extends her hand) follow me. grateful, finn takes it. they're off. locals run amok as tie fighters dive bomb. rey, finn and bb- 8 sprint, blaster explosions get closer and closer! ext. niima outpost - spaceport - day rey, staff strapped to her back, leads the way as she, finn and bb-8 race into the spaceport. finn glances back: two tie fighters bank their return. they yell: finn we can't outrun them! rey points to a parked, four-engine ship ahead: rey we might in that quad-jumper! finn we need a pilot! rey we've got one! (continued) continued: finn you?! (then, indicates one off-camera) what about that ship? rey that one's garbage! they run for the jumper but the passing tie fighters fire at it, blowing it apart in a huge flame ball! rey, coming to a quick stop, right up to camera: rey (cont'd) the garbage'll do! she turns and runs back -- finn and bb-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: the millennium falcon! tie fighters bank around again. finn, rey and bb-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped falcon. int. millennium falcon - day finn, rey and bb-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and the door descends closed as she races to the cockpit: rey gunner position's down there! finn (climbs down) y'ever fly this thing? int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat, frantically flips switches. bb-8 rolls in behind her as the engines whine to life: rey no! this ship hasn't been flown in years! int. millennium falcon - gunner position - day finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the seat whips to the left, startling him -- he grabs the controls to steady himself. finn great. (reacts to seat) whoa! i can do this, i can do this-- int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day rey bucks herself up. doesn't believe her quick words: (continued) continued: rey i can do this, i can do this-- rey pulls the yoke: the falcon engines light up bright! ext. niima outpost - spaceport - day the falcon rises, wildly -- its tarps fly off -- the ship spins and tilts, slams into and crumbles the town's archway! from the tents, unkar plutt runs out, screams: unkar hey!!!! that's miiiiiiine!!! the falcon blasts away, two tie fighters chase it, fast! int. millennium falcon - day rey pilots, headed for the sky! finn swings into frame, trying to work the guns. finn whoa! hey! oh! stay low! stay low! rey what? finn stay low! it confuses their tracking! for a crazy instant rey lets go of the yoke, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- the falcon cants! rey bb-8, hold on! rey finally reaches the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. rey i'm going low!!! ext. desert - day behind the falcon as it dramatically banks at an upward arc, upside-down, then swoops perilously low across the sand. two tie fighters scream past us! int. millennium falcon - day in the cylindrical corridor, bb-8 rolls to the ceiling! rey looks back for a flash as the tie fighters pass -- they are rocked by a blast! (continued) continued: rey what are you doing back there? are you ever gonna fire back?! finn flicks switches -- the gun targeting lights up: finn i'm working on it! are the shields up? rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. rey not so easy without a co-pilot! finn struggles with the gun controls and sweeping chair: finn try sitting in this thing! finn finally fires back at the two tie fighters! ext. desert - day finn's shots miss. the tie fighters arc back in pursuit and scream past us toward the falcon! both ties firing! int. tie fighter cockpit - day the black-suited pilot fires at the falcon. int. millennium falcon - gunner position - day the falcon is rocked by another blast! finn we need cover, quick! int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day rey hits switches, pilots the best she can: rey we're about to get some!

(laughs) (cocky) it was perfect! that was pretty good. they're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced in joy and camaraderie. bb-8 beeps something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels. rey (cont'd) you're ok. he's with the resistance. he's going to get you home. we both will. (to finn) i don't know your name. finn finn. what's yours. rey i'm rey. bb-8 looks at him: really? finn is reminded: he's lied to her. she looks at finn with a sweet smile. finn rey... but before finn can say anything they jump: across the lounge, steam bursts from under the grating. rey help me with this! quick! they hurry to the grating, pull it up together. bb-8 rolls over, watches. finn whoa! what's going on? she goes below as bb-8 beeps concern. ext. space - day the first order star destroyer above jakku. int. star destroyer bridge - day lieutenant mitaka moves to ren, who looks out across the star field. mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.

(bb-8 beeps) i don't speak that. alright, between us, i'm not with the resistance, okay?

(continued) continued: snoke ... leading them to the last jedi. if skywalker returns, the new jedi will rise. general hux supreme leader, i take full responsibility for th-- snoke general! our strategy must now change. general hux the weapon. it is ready. i believe the time has come to use it. we shall destroy the government that supports the resistance, the republic. without their friends to protect them, the resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach skywalker. snoke considers. almost seems to die for a moment. then: snoke go. oversee preparations. general hux yes, supreme leader. general hux, proud, cocksure, exits. kylo ren watches him go. snoke sits. a new intimacy in his voice. snoke there's been an awakening. have you felt it? kylo ren yes. snoke there's something more. the droid we seek is aboard the millennium falcon. in the hands of your father, han solo. kylo ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. kylo ren he means nothing to me. snoke even you, master of the knights of ren, have never faced such a test. (continued) continued: kylo ren (steely resolve) by the grace of your training, i will not be seduced. snoke we shall see. we shall see. a gentle, satisfied nod from snoke, and kylo ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil smile growing -- as he disintegrates -- snoke has been a hologram all along. ext. lightspeed space - day racing with the falcon through the stringlight of lightspeed. int. millennium falcon - day chaos: intercut between the cockpit where han and rey pilot, alarms sounding, problems everywhere, and the lounge where chewie yelps as finn nervously works to bandage his shoulder. sparks! han electrical overload! rey i can fix that! han the coolant's leaking! rey try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- han -- secondary tank, i got it! int. lounge: chewie howls in pain! finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage on chewie's shoulder: chewie roars. bb-8 scurries off. finn chewie, come on! i need help with this giant hairy thing! stop moving! chewie! int. falcon cockpit: han you hurt chewie, you're gonna deal with me! int. lounge: as finn struggles to bandage the wookiee: finn hurt him?! he almost killed me six times! (chewie grabs him by the collar, roars) which is fine. int. falcon cockpit: han this hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. han at the controls when all the alarms stop. rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. han is confused. han (cont'd) what'd you do? rey i by-passed the compressor. he looks at her. a little, appreciative laugh. han exits, walking past bb-8. han move, ball. int. millennium falcon - lounge area - day han kneels at chewie, who lies awake but recovering. han checks his friend's wound with care. chewie moan-talks. han nah, don't say that, you did great. just rest. han turns to finn, who sits at the holochess set, bb-8 beside him. this is awkward for han, but damn, he means it: han (cont'd) good job, kid. and thanks. finn you're welcome. finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the pieces appear, looking up at finn, curiously. the pieces start to fight as finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off. han so, fugitives, huh? rey the first order wants the map. (more) (continued) continued: rey (cont'd) (re: finn and bb-8) finn is with the resistance... (shrugs) ... i'm just a scavenger. han gives finn a skeptical once-over as finn finally manages to turn the chess set off as rey enters. han looks to bb-8. han let's see whatcha got. rey (to bb-8) go ahead. bb-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly projects a holographic map, filling the room. planets, stars, systems. they all react. chewie sits to look up. han moves through stars, becomes reflective. han this map's not complete. it's just a piece. ever since luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. rey why'd he leave? han he was training a new generation of jedi. one boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. luke felt responsible... he walked away from everything. finn do you know what happened to him? han there're a lot of rumors. stories. the people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first jedi temple. rey the jedi were real? han i used to wonder that myself. thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. (beat) 'crazy thing is, it's true. the force, the jedi, all of it. it's all true. (continued) continued: an alarm rings on the control station, prompting han to toggle some switches. bb-8 cuts off the hologram. chewie rises and moans to han, but han motions for chewie to lay back down: han (cont'd) no, you rest.

(continued) continued: rey are you offering me a job? han i wouldn't be nice to you. it doesn't pay much. rey you're offering me a job. han i'm thinking about it. rey wants to say yes. but something stops her. a line she can't cross. han (cont'd) well? rey if you were, i'd be flattered. but i have to get home. han looks at her, questioningly. han jakku? rey looks off, in thought. yeah, jakku. rey (beat) i've already been away too long. han (to chewie) chewie, check out the ship as best you can. han (cont'd) it's too bad. chewie kind of likes you. han heads off. hold on rey. ext. maz's castle - day han walks them to the castle. finn solo, why are we here again? han to get your droid on a clean ship. rey clean? (continued) continued: han do you think it was luck that chewie and i found the falcon? if we can find it on our scanners, the first order's not far behind. want to get bb-8 to the resistance? maz kanata is our best bet. finn we can trust her, right? han relax, kid. she's run this watering hole for a thousand years. maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. and whatever you do, don't stare... rey and finn at what? han any of it. the door opens. music. madness. and... int. maz's castle - main room - day we enter the loud, crowded mess of a hall -- pushing past a room full of rough and odd aliens and humans, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the back of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall alien, who suddenly starts, as if sensing something -- the alien turns to us: she is female, wearing large adjustable goggles. this is maz kanata. maz han solo! everyone turns to look. it's all quiet in here. han (sotto) oh boy. (louder, waving) hey, maz! noise returns. maz walks to them, pushes someone away. maz where's my boyfriend? han chewie's working on the falcon. maz i like that wookiee. i assume you need something. desperately. let's get to it. (continued) continued: maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. finn and rey are confused. han indicates for them to follow. they do -- passing the enormous grummgar, who sits with vixen bazine netal, who watches them suspiciously. a small droid (ga-97), who turns its head to see bb-8 following rey across the room. ga-97, now animated, makes a small transmitting sound, which is subtitled. ga-97 alert the resistance. their missing droid is here! and we cut to: in a dark alcove - moments later bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a communicator. clearly, bazine is a spy. subtitled: bazine inform the first order... i've found the droid. ext. starkiller base - day a massive star destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet. int. star destroyer - kylo ren's chambers - day a dark space. kylo ren, close to camera, addresses someone off-camera whom we do not see. kylo ren forgive me. i feel it again. the pull to the light. supreme leader senses it. show me again, the power of the darkness, and i will let nothing stand in our way. show me, grandfather, and i will finish what you started. as his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we follow him, pivoting to reveal who he was talking to: the burnt, ashen, ghostly deformed mask of darth vader. cut to: int. maz's castle - table - day maz is putting together some food as she says: maz a map to skywalker himself? you're right back in the mess. han maz, i need you to get this droid to leia. (continued) continued: maz hmm. no. you've been running away from this fight for too long. han, nyakee nago wadda. go home! han leia doesn't want to see me. finn please, we came here for your help. rey what fight? maz the only fight: against the dark side. through the ages, i've seen evil take many forms. the sith. the empire. today, it is the first order. their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. we must face them. fight them. all of us. finn there is no fight against the first order! not one we can win. look around. there's no chance we haven't been recognized already. i bet you the first order is on their way right-- finn stops, seeing maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get huge. finn (cont'd) what's this? what are you doing? maz adjusts the goggles again. her eyes get impossibly bigger. she grunts recognition. she hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards finn. finn (cont'd) solo, what is she doing? han i don't know, but it ain't good. maz if you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. i'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. finn (eyes on maz) you don't know a thing about me. where i'm from. what i've seen. (more) (continued) continued: finn (cont'd) you don't know the first order like i do. they'll slaughter us. we all need to run. rey is stunned. maz, not so much. she crawls back to her chair. she points to some pirates in the corner. maz you see those two? they'll trade work for transportation to the outer rim. there, you can disappear. finn sees them. considers. rey finn! finn come with me. rey what about bb-8? we're not done yet. we have to get him back to your base. finn i can't. finn stands to leave. he offers the gun back to han. han keep it, kid. finn heads off. rey gets up to follow. maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to han. maz who's the girl? on finn who has arrived at the table with the alien smugglers. finn i was told you could get me to the outer rim. rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. rey what are you doing? finn gets up to talk to her. finn (to big head) don't leave without me. (continued) continued: embarrassed, finn moves her away. rey you can't just go. i won't let you. finn i'm not who you think i am. rey finn, what are you talking about? finn i'm not resistance. i'm not a hero. i'm a stormtrooper. (stops her) like all of them, i was taken from a family i'll never know. and raised to do one thing... (emotional) but my first battle, i made a choice. i wasn't going to kill for them. so i ran. finn (cont'd) right into you. and you looked at me like no one ever had. i was ashamed of what i was. but i'm done with the first order. i'm never going back. rey, come with me. rey don't go. finn take care of yourself. please. rey looks at him, crushed. with quiet resignation, rey watches finn return to the aliens... and all three head off. he gets to the front door and walks through it. rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. she follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that finn has looked back at her one last time. int. maz' castle - basement corridor - day rey steps down into the basement corridor. bb-8 follows her. walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. she can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. she heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. it is almost as if a soulful vibration draws her closer. she looks at the door lock -- and the door opens. hesitant, rey enters. int. maz's castle - crypt room - day rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden box. she moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. bb-8 nervously follows. rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. a moment heavy with tension. rey opens the box and sees inside luke skywalker's original lightsaber. with hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. as her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. she moves her hand away, as rey hears a mechanical breathing sound. the camera moves, lighting changes -- and we see behind her something impossible: a hallway of from deep inside cloud city. disembodied voices fill the air. young girl no! she stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- turns and sees, through a doorway. we follow rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all tilts -- turns -- and she lands on the wall -- which is now the ground -- dried grass. she turns to look -- we pivot -- and see a burning temple at night. we pan to: r2-d2 -- who watches the flames -- and a man appears (luke, whose face we do not see). he falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a mechanical right hand. we push in on rey as rain begins -- and day turns to night -- and she looks up -- we tilt up -- to see we're looking up at a warrior as he is stabbed by a fiery lightsaber! he screams and falls to the ground -- we follow him, revealing rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. she gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. we pivot around her to reveal kylo ren, and the six other knights of ren, who flank him! come back around to rey, soaking now, as the rain stops and sunlight illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we pivot -- and see... a little girl. rey as a child. she is sobbing, hysterical. unkar plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. she is on jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. young girl no, come back! (continued) continued: unkar plutt quiet, girl! the ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. rey looks around her to see she is.. in a nighttime, barren, snowy woods. she's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: the sound of clashing lightsabers! she moves through the woods, toward the sound. rey runs, heart pounding, when kylo ren emerges from behind a tree! she stops, screams, falls back and lands in: int. maz' castle - basement corridor - day she falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. she hears something and turns to look. maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. rey what was that? i shouldn't have gone in there. maz that lightsaber was luke's. and his father's before him and now, it calls to you! rey stands, fast. still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless. rey i have to get back to jakku. maz han told me. (reaches out, hold rey's hand) dear child. i see your eyes. you already know the truth. whomever you're waiting for on jakku, they're never coming back. but... there's someone who still could. rey luke. maz the belonging you seek is not behind you. it is ahead. i am no jedi, but i know the force. it moves through and surrounds every living thing. close your eyes. feel it. (more) (continued) continued: maz (cont'd) the light. it's always been there. it will guide you. the saber. take it. rey suddenly stands. rey i'm never touching that again. i don't want any part of this. and rey runs off, passing maz. rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. bb-8 follows her. tight on maz, watching her go. maz sighs, feeling for the young girl. ext. maz's castle - day rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. heads toward the woods. ext. forest - day rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. over this, we hear a rumbling -- intense, an omen of something horrible to come. ext. starkiller base - assembly area - day a massive rally: a thousand stormtroopers, tie fighters, officers and vehicles. brutalist structures, mountainous snowy landscape. addressing them at a podium, flanked by red first order banners, is hux. his voice echoes: general hux today is the end of the republic! the end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! at this very moment, in a system far from here the new republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome resistance. this fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the senate! to their cherished fleet! all remaining systems will bow to the first order! and will remember this... as the last day of the republic! int. starkiller base - control room - day engineers perform final firing protocol. there's a sense of nervousness -- will this massive weapon actually work? ext. starkiller base - assembly area - day general hux fire! and hux turns to give the signal as we cut back wide -- a roar of boots on pavement as the thousand stormtroopers turn to face an endless snowy landscape. what is about to happen?! ext. starkiller base - day a view past the rally. for a moment, nothing. then, eerily silent, an impossible blast of fire light -- like an atomic bomb test times a zillion -- blasts from miles away, into the sky! seconds later, a terrible explosive roar! the troopers -- everyone -- is nearly pushed back by the force of it -- the magnitude! many have to cover their eyes! for miles around the firebeam, ice and snow melts instantly! runoff tunnels flooded with an ocean of fresh water. airborne creatures by the thousands burst from trees and take flight. hux watches, his eyes wild with power and evil. from his eyes, cut to: int. star destroyer bridge - day tight on kylo ren as he watches the starkiller firing. ext. maz' castle - day finn boards the alien freighter. the sound from the sky makes him turn back. he sees the path of fire and his blood runs cold, his heart sinks. ext. republic system - night at a massive distance we see planets the republic capital system -- increasingly lit, then powerfully hit by the vast fireblast which obliterates it all! ext. republic city - night the galaxy center of government at night. impressive structures. senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. light growing -- from a great distance a circle of fire -- like a small sun appearing from nowhere and growing close and massive, turning night to day! and in seconds the fire blocks out everything else, and the entire planet of hosnian prime is incinerated! ext. maz's castle - day a crowd of aliens files out from inside, all eyes on the fire in the sky. dozens of languages exclaiming fear and horror. find han and chewie moving out, looking up. (continued) continued: finn (o.s.) it was the republic. han and chewie turn as finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. with dread: finn (cont'd) the first order, they've done it. where's rey? ext. forest - day rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. at an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. then she hears a beep -- turns to see bb-8, catching up with her. rey what are you doing? (he beeps) you have to go back. (he beeps again) rey (cont'd) bb-8. no, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. they'll help you. then, another sound -- louder now -- they look up again: in front of the system attack, a fleet of first order ships roar overhead, toward the castle! rey's heart sinks: her friends are in danger! int. maz's castle - basement corridor - day maz leads han, finn and chewie down the hall, fast: maz i've had this for ages... maz's castle - treasure room - day maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to finn: maz kept it locked away. han where'd you get that? maz a good question for another time.

(bb-8 beeps; bravely through her fear) i hope so, too. bb-8 beeps and heads off -- rey runs and takes cover behind a massive, mossy tree. tight on her terrified face -- ext. castle debris - day han, chewie, finn and maz, exhausted, climb up, peek through debris. (continued) continued: han come on, chewie! maz turns to finn: maz rey and bb-8, they need you. now go. finn i need a weapon. maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- the saber. maz you have one! he looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! he turns it on. han and chewie run, take cover from blasts, firing back at stormtroopers, taking some out! han hey, can i try that? han borrows chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on stormtroopers and sends them flying. han (cont'd) (to chewbacca) i like this thing. finn surprises a stormtrooper with the lightsaber, then another! untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. one stormtrooper has a mace -- stormtrooper traitor! finn and the trooper with the mace battle. the mace trooper knocks finn down! the stormtrooper is about to end him, when the stormtrooper is shot and falls! wide-eyed finn sees han run over, having fired the blast! han helps him up. han you okay, big deal? finn thanks! but ten stormtroopers come over a rise, blasters aimed. stormtrooper don't move! tk-338, we have targets in custody! (continued) continued: no way out, they drop their weapons: tight on the lightsaber as it hits the ground. a stormtrooper hand picks it up. han's mind races as a squad of troopers appears behind them. finn, han and chewie are marched by stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. but then -- a familiar roar ripping across the lake -- han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, x- wings and resistance spacecraft appear, begin firing at the first order ships! push in on han, hope surging -- chewie talks. stormtrooper (cont'd) we have incoming at two-eight-point- six! move! dispatch! move! scramble all squads! repeat, scramble all squads! anti-air cover en route to our position! han it's the resistance. one x-wing in particular -- marked in black -- swoops down and takes out the parked tie fighters and troopers! int. poe's x-wing - day it's poe dameron at the stick of his x-wing. poe go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! jess (v.o.) copy that! snap (v.o.) we're with you, poe! the stormtroopers around finn, han and chewie scatter, tossed in explosions! the lightsaber lands again -- finn picks it up. han quick! chewie picks up his bowcaster, han takes the blaster. shoots a trooper. finn woohoo! yeah! that's one helluva pilot! int. poe's x-wing - day poe woohoo! ext. forest - day in the darkened woods, rey, terrified, keeps her blaster aimed. her eyes dart around for her pursuer. and then: the unique sound of kylo ren's rasping lightsaber coming to life -- a sound she's heard before in the forceback. rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. kylo ren appears from behind a tree -- rey fires again and again -- kylo ren moves toward her, using his lightsaber to deflect every blast. she fires ferociously, but kylo ren keeps coming! his hand rises -- rey suddenly stops -- gasps -- unable to move. kylo ren the girl i've heard so much about. he walks around her, slowly, she won't let herself cry. kylo ren (cont'd) the droid. he comes around to see her face. after a scary beat he whips his saber up to her eyes, illuminating her face. kylo ren (cont'd) where is it? wide shot: the epic battle between resistance and first order troops, reflected in the still lake. stormtrooper request air support! ext. forest - day kylo ren turns off his saber, reaches up... and reaches towards rey's face. she can't move, strains in agony. after a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand. she is relieved but still afraid. kylo ren the map. you've seen it. rey is horrified. he touches her face again: the pain, tears stream. kylo ren, taking more from her mind... she stares at him, terrified, straining in agony -- kylo ren, mid-interrogation, turns toward the sound of the explosions. stormtroopers approach through the woods. stormtrooper #5 sir, resistance fighters! we need more troops. kylo ren turns back to rey, his hand still on her face. (continued) continued: kylo ren pull the division out. forget the droid. we have what we need. a gesture from kylo ren and rey loses consciousness, falls from frame! ext. castle debris - day the black-marked x-wing swoops down again, firing, exploding another tie fighter! on the ground: stormtrooper pull back the tree line! han and chewie dodge debris, firing and taking out troopers. finn takes out 2 troopers with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: kylo ren in the forest, carrying rey in his arms, into his shuttle! finn's heart shatters -- han stops -- turns -- sees kylo ren entering his shuttle. han is rocked. finn no!! rey!!! heroically, finn runs toward the shuttle through laser blasts and explosions, but the shuttle takes off -- finn irrationally chases it, screams desperately: finn (cont'd) no, no, no, no... rey!! in crazed frustration, finn stops running, watches the receding first order ships, rey their captive. ext. forest - day bb-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the first order ships retreat, off planet. a considered beat, and bb-8 heads back for the castle. ext. maz's castle ruins - day post battle. finn runs to han: finn he took her! did you see that? he took her. she's gone! han (walks past) yeah, yeah, i know... and he and chewie head off. ext. maz's castle ruins - day han moves toward a resistance transport landing in the debris. bb-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. on han's face, knowing exactly what's about to happen. finally, the transport door opens. and standing there is leia. she sees han and is stunned. a silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. in the smoke and embers, no one says a word. then c-3po walks out from the transport, into the field: c-3po goodness! han solo! it is i, see- threepio! (sees han, stops) you probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees leia, increasingly awkward) look who it is! did you see who? oh. excuse me, prin-- uh, general. sorry. come along, bb-8. quickly. (bb-8 beeps) yes, i must get my proper arm reinstalled. he hurries off. finally, alone again. han you changed your hair. leia same jacket. han no, new jacket. chewie glad to see leia, greets her with a hug. chewie moans a few words, looks at han then boards the ship. it is complicated and loving and painful. han says, quietly: han (cont'd) ... i saw him. leia, i saw our son. he was here. leia hears this. maz watches through the smoke. ext. space - day the falcon and surviving x-wings roar past camera toward a planet with green flora and a ring of asteroids. (continued) continued: this is d'qar. ext. d'qar - day the ships descending among grassy mounds and sunken structures. ext. resistance base - day large grass mounds cover hangars, beneath the odd, giant trees. boom down as resistance ground crew direct an x-wing to a landing. in the foreground, another x-wing canopy opens, a pilot climbs out. pan to reveal the landed millennium falcon. finn runs down the ramp, up to camera, desperate, searching. then bb-8 speeds right past him, almost knocking him down -- finn watches as bb-8 rolls over to the pilot getting out of the black-marked x-wing. the pilot's helmet comes off. it is poe! finn can't believe what he's seeing. and poe, kneeling in warm reunion with bb-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. poe looks up and sees finn -- and he can't believe it either! poe smiles, points at finn. from a distance, finn gestures in sheer amazement that poe is alive. finn poe. poe dameron. they move to each other -- and embrace. finn (cont'd) you're alive! poe so are you! finn what happened to you? poe what happened? i got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- bb-8 beeps -- poe listens, turns to finn. poe (cont'd) bb-8 says that you saved him. finn no, no, no. it wasn't just me. poe you completed my mission, finn. that's my jacket? (continued) continued: finn oh here. poe no, no, no. keep it. it suits you. you're a good man, finn. finn poe -- i need your help. int. resistance base - day move fast with finn and poe. finn takes in this makeshift command center, buried deep among vines and roots. they arrive at leia, who stands with a group of resistance officers, including admirals ackbar and statura: poe general organa. sorry to interrupt, this is finn, he needs to talk to you -- leia (takes finn's hand) and i need to talk to him. that was incredibly brave, what you did. renouncing the first order, saving this man's life -- finn (surprised she knows) thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- leia han told me about the girl, i'm sorry. finn is startled -- poe jumps in: poe finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the hosnian system. he worked on the base. leia we're desperate for anything you can tell us. finn that's where my friend was taken -- i've got to get there, fast. leia and i will do everything i can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. int. resistance base - day chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. dr. kalonia uses a device to help heal his shoulder. chewie talks. dr. kalonia (chewie talks) that sounds very scary. (chewie talks) you must be so brave. chewie agrees. int. resistance base - day c-3po takes the data device from bb-8 and inserts it into a base computer. the projected map appears in hologram. leia enters, studying it, dispirited. pan as she moves, revealing han. c-3po is here and some others. c-3po general, i regret to inform you, but this map recovered from bb-8 is only partially complete. and even worse, it matches no charted system on record. we simply do not have enough information to locate master luke. leia i can't believe i was so foolish to think that i could just find luke and bring him home. han leia... leia don't do that. han do what? she heads off. leia anything. flummoxed, han follows looking at c-3po. c-3po princesses. han follows leia across the base floor: han i'm trying to be helpful! (continued) continued: leia when did that ever help? and don't say the death star. han (sighs) int. resistance base - day low with bb-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and dusty tarp in a corner, r2-d2. bb-8 beeps at r2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. but r2 doesn't respond at all. bb-8 tries again. nothing. bb-8 nudges r2. nothing. then: c-3po (o.s.) bb-8. you're wasting your time. bb-8 looks up at c-3po, who stands there. c-3po sighs. c-3po (cont'd) it is very doubtful that r2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. (bb-8 beeps) i am afraid not. r2-d2 has been in low power mode ever since master luke went away. sadly, he may never be his old self again. int. resistance base - day leia hears the change in han's voice and softens. she turns. han listen to me, will you? i know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. leia you think i want to forget him? i want him back! han looks at her with sympathy. han there was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) there was too much vader in him. leia that's why i wanted him to train with luke. i just never should have sent him away. that's when i lost him. that's when i lost you both. (continued) continued: han we both had to deal with it in our own way. i went back to the only thing i was ever good at. leia we both did. han we lost our son, forever. leia no. (long beat) it was snoke. han takes this in. leia (cont'd) he seduced our son to the dark side. but we can still save him. me. you. han if luke couldn't reach him, how could i? leia luke is a jedi... you're his father. there's still light in him. i know it. general statura general, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. int. starkiller base - holding cell - day rey wakes, disoriented. she is in an angled, upright restraining rig. looks over, startled to see kylo ren, mask in place, standing there. rey where am i? kylo ren (long beat) you're my guest. rey where are the others? kylo ren you mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (rey stares at him) you'll be relieved to hear that i have no idea. (continued) continued: rey studies him. she's fearful... but curious. kylo ren (cont'd) you still want to kill me. rey that happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. kylo ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and removes his mask. rey reacts, stunned. it takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. kylo ren tell me about the droid. rey (a nervous beat) he's a bb unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- kylo ren he's carrying a section of a navigational chart. we have the rest, recovered from archives of the empire. we need the last piece. and somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. you. a scavenger -- rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? kylo ren (cont'd) you know i can take whatever i want. trepidation flashes across rey's eyes. kylo ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. she recoils, but has nowhere to go. kylo ren nearly touches her face... they're both surprised: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- an energy they recognize in each other. and then it's gone. adversaries again. rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist ren's probing. kylo ren (cont'd) ... you're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) at night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. i see it -- i see the island... tears stream down her face as she resists. she tries to break free, but can't budge. kylo ren (cont'd) and han solo. you feel like he's the father you never had. he would've disappointed you. (continued) continued: his hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: rey -- get out of my head -- but this just makes kylo lean closer. kylo ren i know you've seen the map. it's in there... and now you'll give it to me. don't be afraid. i feel it too. where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: rey i'm not giving you anything. kylo ren we'll see. he peers into her eyes intensely. she meets his gaze -- despite the pain she is strong. on ren's face as his confidence begins to melt away. he has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. he looks less certain by the moment as rey seems to grow in strength. the ferocity of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass and rey does the unthinkable! she enters his head, amazed at what she is seeing! rey ... you... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... darth vader! kylo ren suddenly withdraws his hand, as if her face were fire hot. takes a step back, confused, rattled. rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on kylo ren, who starts to leave. and we prelap: snoke (v.o.) this scavenger, resisted you? int. starkiller planet - assembly room - night kylo ren, mask off, stands before snoke. kylo ren she's strong with the force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. and while ren's mind no doubt goes to luke: snoke and the droid? (continued) continued: kylo ren hesitates to reveal the truth. then: general hux (o.s.) ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. ren turns back -- hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside ren. general hux (cont'd) that the girl was all we needed. as a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. they may have the map already. snoke is visibly furious. snoke then the resistance must be destroyed before they get to skywalker. general hux we have their location. we tracked their reconnaissance ship to the ileenium system. snoke good. then we will crush them once and for all. prepare the weapon. kylo ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all -- kylo ren supreme leader. i can get the map from the girl. i just need your guidance. snoke if what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. int. starkiller base - holding cell - day slow push in on rey, shackled, mind still racing over what's happened between her and kylo ren. she is flooded with emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible. she turns to the stormtrooper guard. studies him for an intense beat. then says: rey you will remove these restraints. and leave this cell, with the door open. the stormtrooper guard looks at her. a beat. (continued) continued: trooper guard #2 what did you say? rey's eyes stay trained on him. she shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority: rey you will remove these restraints. and leave this cell, with the door open. the stormtrooper guard, rifle aimed, moves for her. rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? the tension unbearable when the guard says: trooper guard #2 i'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! int. starkiller base - corridor 1 - day low angle: kylo ren, masked, rounds a corner, passes us. int. starkiller base - holding cell - day rey stares intently at the trooper. calms herself. and tries again. rey you will remove these restraints. and leave this cell, with the door open. trooper guard #2 i will remove these restraints. and leave this cell, with the door open. he reaches down and unlatches the restraints. he then turns and starts to head out, her back to him as he exits. she is in shock. then tries, quickly: rey and you will drop your weapon. trooper guard #2 and i'll drop my weapon. the trooper guard drops his weapon without turning back -- rey hears the gun fall. she's incredulous. the guard has left the cell, its door open. rey, in absolute disbelief, moves quickly out of frame! int. starkiller base - holding cell - day kylo ren enters the cell -- we push in on him as he takes in the empty cell -- and immediately understands what has happened. (continued) continued: kylo ren no! enraged, he rips out his saber and -- ext. starkiller base - corridor 1 - day wide angle, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only hear the horrible sounds. destruction. yelling. a few pieces of red hot debris bounces into the corridor. two stormtroopers, crossing at the far end of the hall, stop to watch this display of pure fury. they retreat, and fast. int. starkiller base - control room - day workers at their controls. vast snowy landscape seen outside. their gauges rise -- the weapon charging slowly -- general hux begin charging the weapon! starkiller technician yes, sir. weapon charging. ext. starkiller base planet - day a vast view of the planet -- a massive solarvac array surrounds a port ten miles in diameter. millions of panels turn on the array -- a wave of brilliant reflections. suddenly, like a planetary-scale tesla coil line of energy, the power of the sun begins to travel down to the starkiller base planet. int. resistance base - day finn, now a member of the inner circle of the resistance, is huddled with the group around the map table, which displays a wireframe hologram of a rolling view of the surface of starkiller base. with finn are han, leia, poe, c-3po, statura, ackbar, brance, snap, major ematt (60), nien nunb, and others. an urgent, messy strategy session -- poe the scan data from snap's reconnaissance flight confirms finn's report. snap they've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. brance a laser cannon? (continued) continued: snap we're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. major ematt (horrible memories) it's another death star. poe i wish that were the case, major. poe hits a control. a wireframe of the death star appears. poe (cont'd) this was the death star. poe hits another control -- the death star shrinks -- and shrinks and shrinks, as the surface area of the starkiller base is drawn into a larger image, revealing the entire base planet. the death star is a minuscule satellite in comparison. poe (cont'd) this is starkiller base. this is news to many here, and they're stunned. han so it's big. admiral ackbar how is it possible to power a weapon of this size? finn it uses the power of the sun. as the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. an officer runs up, hands leia a datacard. leia (eyes on datacard) the first order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) our system is the next target. c-3po oh my. without the republic fleet, we're doomed. they all react to this horrible news. han okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) there's always a way to do that. (continued) continued: but no one has anything. leia watches the silence, frustrated. finally, rallying them: leia han's right. han is surprised. admiral statura (at first hesitant) in order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... finn there is one. all eyes on finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the starkiller base -- it is zoomed in: a giant black hexagonal structure. finn (cont'd) precinct 47. here. admiral statura (hypothesizing) if we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. major ematt ... maybe the planet. poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the big hexagonal structure: the oscillator. poe we'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. admiral ackbar they have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. han we disable the shields. (to finn) kid, you worked there, what do you got? finn (beat, then:) i can do it. han i like this guy. (continued) continued: finn i can disable the shields. but i have to be there, on the planet-- han we'll get you there. leia han, how? han if i told you, you wouldn't like it. poe so we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. all right. let's go! and everyone splits. ext. hangars, resistance base - day series of shots: the resistance fleet prepares for its mission. pilots inspect crafts, including snap, nien nunb, and poe at his black-marked x-wing. mechanics make adjustments as crews fuel the jets. ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. pilots prep their ships, including bb-8, who is pulled into poe's black x-wing. finn approaches poe wearing the jacket. poe slaps finn's shoulder as he heads off. finn watches poe, despite it all, a little laugh. over this: ext. resistance base - day chewie and finn follow han's orders as they prepare the falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last: han chewie, check that donal capitator. come on. let's go. -- finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. finn now you tell me? leia no matter how much we fought, i've always hated watching you leave. han looks over, there's leia. han that's what i did it. so you'd miss me. she laughs, moves up close to him. (continued) continued: leia i did miss you. he looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue: han it wasn't all bad, was it? huh? some of it was...good. leia ... pretty good. han some things never change. leia (smiles) true. you still drive me crazy. han places his hands on her shoulders. it could be thirty years ago. they both know there's a good chance he won't make it back. they pull each other tight, holding for dear life. quietly, longingly: leia (cont'd) if you see our son again, bring him home. int. starkiller base - day stormtrooper sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. we're searching the area. kylo ren she's just beginning to test her powers. the longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. kylo exits. int. starkiller base - atrium area - day tight on rey's face as she peers nervously around a corner. rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the trooper guard's rifle held tight. ext. lightspeed space - day the falcon screams past -- int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day flying at lightspeed, finn, with han and chewie. (continued) continued: finn how are we getting in? han their shields have a fractional refresh rate. keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. finn is suddenly filled with dread. finn we're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: hell yes we are! han alright, chewie, get ready. chewie groans: he's ready. han studies the panel indicators. han (cont'd) and now! chewie and han hit switches -- ext. lightspeed space/starkiller base - day the falcon's environment shifts instantly from lightspeed to planet atmosphere -- it's suddenly flying 100 feet above the snowy, rocky ground, headed for a thick forest! int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day chewie groans: han i am pulling up!!! ext. starkiller base - day but the falcon has no time -- it plows through the trees! it then rises -- int. millennium falcon - cockpit - day alarms blare as the ship slams through branches, shoots toward sky! han does his best to steer -- chewie groans -- in the madness han yells: han i get any higher, they'll see us! and the ship dives again, back into the trees! ext. starkiller base - clearing - day a quiet clearing on the forest treeline. suddenly the millennium falcon hurtles out of the forest! from an eruption of branches and pine, the ship dives -- slams into the snow! it digs through a thousand yards of white until it finally comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow! int. starkiller base - day officer sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. kylo ren put every hangar on lock-down. she's going to try to steal a ship to-- suddenly, kylo senses something. something familiar. kylo ren (cont'd) han solo... ext. starkiller base - day massive wide shot of an epic snowscape. han, finn and chewie cross the terrain. walkers appears on the horizon. han, finn and chewie take cover behind a base structure. chewie carries a black duffel of explosives. finn the flooding tunnels are over that ridge. we'll get in that way. han what was your job when you were based here? finn sanitation. han sanitation? then how do you know how to disable the shields? finn i don't. i'm just here to get rey. han people are counting on us! the galaxy is counting on us--! finn solo, we'll figure it out! we'll use the force! han that's not how the force works--! (continued) continued: chewie moantalks. han (cont'd) oh really, you're cold? finn come on! they follow finn on the snowy hike. on the horizon, the laser siphon shooting into the sky, slowly sucking the sun dry. int. starkiller base - control room - day technicians at work, the sun sucking seen in the window behind him. general hux report. first order officer weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. int. starkiller base - corridor 4 - day a stormtrooper waits to board a transport compartment. the door whooshes open -- han, finn and chewie are there! stormtrooper fn-9330 hey! he fumbles for his blaster but chewie shoots first. wide angle of the corridor as the trooper flies back, dead. chewie drags him out of sight. han and finn peer around a corner, wary. han the longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. the shields? finn i have an idea about that. han and chewie follow finn. int. starkiller base - corridor - day captain phasma heads down a corridor, distant stormtroopers. suddenly phasma is t-boned hard and fast -- shoved out of frame by chewie! and now we're in a narrow cross-corridor, chewie with his arms around phasma, forced to face finn, who holds his blaster on his former captain. han stands behind finn. finn remember me? (continued) continued: captain phasma fn-2187. finn not anymore. the name's finn, and i'm in charge. i'm in charge now, phasma. i'm in charge. han bring it down. bring it down. finn follow me. finn smiles as we cut to: int. starkiller base - atrium area - day tight on rey's face as she peers nervously around a corner. rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the trooper guard's rifle held tight. from this alcove, she can see down another long, perpendicular walkway -- on one side, a stone and steel wall. on the other side, a vast atrium, with a railing-free drop off, the white pill-light design descending hundreds of feet. at the end of this walkway is an open hangar door, revealing hundreds of tie fighters parked outside. tight on rey's face as her plan is clear. but the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a group of stormtroopers. guards, in conversation. as she tries to think about what to do next, we see, far behind her in the perpendicular hall, another group of storm- and snowtroopers headed her way! rey's mind races -- another peek out and she runs fast, across the walkway, and climbs down -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the troopers approach and continue. wide shot as rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. but then she sees something and has a brainstorm. she strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible service hatch, which she opens, and climbs inside the wall, closing the hatch behind her. int. starkiller base - inside the walls - day a remarkable image, inside the inner workings of the base. tiny by comparison, rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. she is between the light source and the white pill shapes, as she makes her way across. int. starkiller base - atrium area - day wide shot of the stormtrooper guards, above the drop off into the atrium. what they cannot see is a shadowed silhouette of rey against the endless white pill lights as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! int. starkiller base - control access point - day close as phasma sits into frame in front of a workstation -- finn, han and chewie, blasters aimed. phasma reluctantly works controls on the workstation. finn you want me to blast that bucket off your head? lower the shields. captain phasma you're making a big mistake. finn do it. chewie moan/talks. phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls beep-click.

(continued) continued: once they're gone, he plants another charge. ext. starkiller base - oscillator structure - near darkness the snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. finn and rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: the sun is nearly gone. int. oscillator structure - lower level - night han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he hears something and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. he peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- han's pov: kylo ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. we're with kylo ren as he resumes his hunt. he heads directly toward where han is hiding! kylo ren has an increasing sense of han's presence as he moves closer. he comes to where han was hiding -- but han is nowhere to be seen. from his hiding place in a narrow, power chamber in the wall, han watches his son pass only a few feet in front of him. han shifts his position in the tight compartment, so he can watch ren's progress. kylo ren turns onto a flat bridge that bisects the open space. unaware of his father, kylo ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. han watches his son walk off -- the clank- clank of kylo ren's boots receding. this is han's opportunity to escape but leia's words echo through his mind. he makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. he calls out, strongly: han ben! the name echoes as kylo ren stops, far across the vast catwalk. he turns. kylo ren han solo. i've been waiting for this day for a long time. finn and rey make their way into the space, opening a hatch that allows a beam of precious sunlight to stream down like a spotlight on han and his son. finn and rey get to a railing and look down. they can see and hear han and kylo ren on the catwalk below. (continued) continued: han take off that mask. you don't need it. kylo ren what do you think you'll see if i do? han moves toward kylo ren. han the face of my son. kylo takes off his mask. han is jolted -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. kylo ren your son is gone. he was weak and foolish, like his father. so i destroyed him. han that's what snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. my son is alive. several levels below them, chewie comes to the rail to watch. int. oscillator structure - lower level - near darkness kylo flares. kylo ren no. the supreme leader is wise. up above, finn, chewie and rey watch, rapt. stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. on the bridge, han moves closer, stern: han snoke is using you for your power. when he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. kylo hesitates. somehow, he does know it. kylo ren it's too late. han no it's not. leave here with me. come home. we miss you. for the first time, kylo ren seems truly conflicted. tears flood his stoic eyes... kylo ren i'm being torn apart. i want to be free of this pain. int. oscillator structure - darkness falls han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. kylo ren i know what i have to do, but i don't know if i have the strength to do it. will you help me? han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. han yes. anything. kylo ren unholsters his lightsaber and slowly extends it to han, within a foot of han's chest. han almost can't believe it. the moment seems to last forever. and just then, the last beam of sunlight streaming through the open hatch vanishes. han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, kylo ren's eyes fill with darkness, he ignites the lightsaber -- the fiery blade shoots out, right through han's chest and back! kylo ren thank you. above, finn and rey gasp -- scream -- finn (panting) solo. rey (also panting) no, no. han's last moment is looking into his son's face. han's knees buckle. the blade tilts down with him... until kylo ren extinguishes it and han holds onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. finally han falls back, off the catwalk, into the depths of the structure! int. resistance base - day leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, devastated. int. oscillator structure - night kylo ren is somehow weakened by this wicked act. himself horrified. his shock is broken only when -- chewie cries out in agony! chewie furiously fires at kylo ren, hitting him in the side! kylo ren falls back, stunned.

(continued) continued: kylo ren it's just us now. han solo can't save you. after a beat, rey moves forward with the blaster -- aims it! kylo ren raises a hand -- rey struggles under his force power -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the wound chewie inflicted. kylo ren gestures powerfully -- rey's blaster flies out of her hand -- another gesture and rey flies back and slams into a tree thirty feet away! she drops -- lands hard in the snow. dazed, hurt. finn rey! rey! rey... rey... oh no. oh no no no... finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. but the sound of kylo ren's lightsaber moving makes finn turn back to kylo ren, lit by the glowing yellow and red blade. kylo ren traitor! in reply, finn turns on luke's lightsaber -- upon seeing the weapon, kylo ren reacts in shock. kylo ren (cont'd) that lightsaber. it belongs to me! finn come get it. despite his fear, finn raises his blade in welcome. kylo ren charges at him - finn terrified -- kylo ren lunges but finn deflects ren's spark-spitting blade! kylo ren turns, attacks, cuts -- amazingly finn blocks, counter-attacks -- clearly impresses kylo ren, who only enjoys this challenge more! rey recovers, gets her bearings. her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. kylo ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal savagery -- finn blocks, turning defensive moves into offensive ones. and he actually gets a hit in! luke's saber grazing kylo ren's arm! kylo moves back -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. kylo ren charges again -- their weapons pound, sparks fly, their blades lock, the men are close, lit by the powerful, crashing sabers: and kylo ren pushes finn back, attacks with pure ferocity -- finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. rey sees this -- kylo ren unleashes a merciless series of blows, pushing finn further and further back until he loses balance. (continued) continued: that's when kylo ren strikes: he lands a blow to finn's torso -- luke's lightsaber flies from finn's hand, thrown twenty feet! kylo ren turns off his lightsaber and reaches for luke's lightsaber -- beckoning it with the force. luke's lightsaber vibrates in the snow. kylo ren gestures, increases his power -- luke's lightsaber finally flies out of the snow, bullets toward kylo ren -- -- and speeds past him! kylo ren turns to see luke's lightsaber land in the hand of rey, who stands, facing him, having reached for it herself, but utterly stunned that it landed in her hand! she is shocked -- and so is kylo ren! holding it with both hands, she ignites luke's lightsaber for the first time, her eyes blazing. kylo ren ignites his saber. it's rey who charges now -- kylo ren immediately on the defensive. they battle powerfully -- he is clearly rocked by her raw, innate skill. int. x-wing - night niv lek we just lost r-1! jess we're overwhelmed! what do we do? it isn't working! another pilot looks down -- sees the explosion -- coming from the oscillator. relatively small, it's an opening: yolo ziff black leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. looks like our friends got in! poe red four! red six! cover us! lt. bastian i'm on it! ello asty roger! poe everybody else, hit the target hard! give it everything you got! and the x-wings dive and blast the oscillator -- ext. starkiller base - oscillator - night another two x-wings -- including poe's -- soar through the trench leading to the oscillator structure! poe i need some help here! i need some help! lt. bastian i'm coming in! jess watch out! ello asty i'm hit! the alien pilot's x-wing is blasted to pieces. poe all teams - i'm going in! pull up and cover me! niv lek copy that, black leader! good luck, poe! the trailing x-wings peel off as poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. int. starkiller base - control room - near darkness outside, the sun almost completely gone -- pull back through the window to reveal a starkiller technician: starkiller technician weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. general hux prepare to fire. ext. starkiller base - oscillator - night poe's x-wing weaves through the breach. a pursuing tie fighter does not clear the gap, leaving poe to circle the interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after volley of torpedoes. ext. starkiller base - oscillator - night the remaining x-wings -- including poe's -- blast the place -- and the structure begins to crater, deep underground explosions! ext. forest - night amid the bare white trees, only two lightsabers -- luke's blue and ren's yellow-red -- illuminate the flurries of snow as rey and kylo ren battle hard. she seems to be, impossibly, stronger than he is for half a dozen blows -- until he finds his strength and fights back -- moving forward and pushing rey back, into the forest. suddenly a colossal chunk of the forest right behind rey drops away! rey is suddenly fighting on the edge of a massive, brand new cliff! kylo ren you need a teacher! i can show you the ways of the force! rey the force. rey closes her eyes for a long beat. when rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she pounds back, single handed swipes, hitting ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible force. it's so fast now, so furious, that kylo ren falls back -- she attacks harder! ren gets up again but she hits his saber's hilt -- his blade goes flying off, tumbling into the snow -- and she slashes again and again and hits kylo ren square in the head and chest. he goes down, suddenly a fearful man, a large burn scar slashed across his face! he still reaches for his saber. and she could kill him -- right now, with one vicious strike! but she stops. realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. the earth shakes. the earth splits. a gully forms. int. starkiller base - control room - night the area where the rally was held is now collapsing into a giant sink hole! we whip pan to a young technician, who watches this out the control room window in horror. he hurries off, passing colonel datoo, who admonishes: colonel datoo lieutenant, get back to your station! young technician (stops, fleetingly) just look. we won't survive -- even hux has gone! as he hurries off, we hear: general hux (v.o.) supreme leader. int. starkiller base - assembly room - night hux stands before snoke's image. relative quiet here, but distant sounds of destruction. hux tries to keep it together but is horrified, heartsick: general hux the fuel cells have ruptured. the collapse of the planet has begun. snoke takes this in. furious, desolate... knowing. snoke leave the base at once and come to me with kylo ren. (grim) it is time to complete his training. ext. forest - night rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to: finn, who lies, near death, not far from where the ground fell away. rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over, sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound. rey finn! finn... tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. they are left here to die -- nearby more trees drop as the planet continues to collapse. and just as it seems like all is lost... her wet eyes look up to see: lights rise from the newly-formed canyon -- it's a ship we know -- it's the millennium falcon -- and its lights illuminate rey, whose face fills with hope! chewie is at the controls. he roars to them! ext. falcon - night chewie exits the ship. moments later chewie carries finn up the ramp. rey hurries with them back into the ship -- int. falcon - night chewie carries finn inside, followed by rey. ext. space - night and we fly with the falcon as it leaves the planet -- we can see chewie and rey piloting, the collapsing planet behind us. the resistance x-wings, led by poe, follow the falcon. int. x-wing - night poe all teams! i got eyes on them! snap yes! the x-wings roar off, skyward as the music soars, the planet implodes -- the sunlight it contains bursts forth, and as we get further and further distance from what was starkiller base, we witness the rebirth of a sun. light restored to a corner of the galaxy. the millennium falcon and the x-wings rip through space, headed home. poe our job's done here. let's go home! ext. d'qar - day establishing shot as the falcon on the landing strip. ext. resistance base - day the falcon has landed among the remaining resistance ships. poe is there, watching as chewie scuttles down the ramp carrying an unconscious finn. medical personnel and officers, meet them, usher them inside. medic easy, easy. he's hurt. we've got a heartbeat. rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, leia. c-3po and bb-8 behind her. the crowds are cheering. rey is so sad for leia, so sorry. the two women move for each other. and leia takes rey's face in her hands. despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. she embraces rey. a mother's embrace. rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting. int. resistance base - day chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning their losses. as bb-8 approaches r2-d2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. the droids beep at each other. c-3po r2-d2! you've come back! you found what? how dare you call me that!

Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
turmoil has engulfed the galactic republic. the taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute. hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy trade federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of naboo. while the congress of the republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the supreme chancellor has secretly dispatched two jedi knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict..... pan down to reveal a small space cruiser heading toward camera at great speed. pan with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of trade federation battleships. int. republic cruiser - cockpit in the cockpit of the cruise, the captain and pilot maneuver closer to one of the battleships. qui-gon : (off screen voice) captain. the captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her. captain : yes, sir? qui-gon : (v.o) tell them we wish to board at once. captain : yes, sir. the captain looks to her view screen, where nute gunray, a neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply. captain : (cont'd) with all due respect for the trade federation, the ambassodors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately. nute : yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the ambassador...happy to. the screen goes black. out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer. ext. federation battleship - docking bay - space (fx) the small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the federation battleship. int. federation battleship - docking bay - space a protocol droid, tc-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. two worker droids, pk-4 and eg-9 watch. pk-4 : they must be important if the viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them. the door opens, and the republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay. two darkly robed figures are greeted by tc-14. tc-14 : i'm tc-14 at your service. this way, please. they move off down the hallway. eg-9 : a republic cruiser! that's trouble...don't you think? pr-4 : i'm not made to think. int. federation battleship - conference room a door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led past camera into the formal conference room by tc-14. tc-14 : i hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. my master will be with you shortly. the droid bows before obi-wan kenobi and qui- gon jinn. he backs out the door and it closes. the jedi lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of naboo. qui-gon sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail. he is tall and striking, with blue eyes. obi-wan is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. several exotic, bird-like creatures sing in a cage near the door. obi-wan : i have a bad feeling about this. qui-gon : i don't sense anything. obi-wan : it's not about the mission, master, it's somethging...elsewhere...elusive. qui-gon : don't center on your anxiety, obi-wan. keep your concentration here and now where it belongs. obi-wan : master yoda says i should be mindful of the future... qui-gon : .....but not at the expense of the moment. be mindful of the living force, my young padawan. obi-wan : yes, master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands? qui-gon : these federation types are cowards. the negotiations will be short. int. federation battleship - bridge nute gunray and daultray dofine stand, stunned, before tc-14. nute : (shaken) what?!? what did you say? tc-14 : the ambassadors are jedi knights, i believe. dofine : i knew it! they were sent to force a settlement, eh. blind me, we're done for! int. federation battleship - hallway a hologram of nute , surrounded by battle droids, appears in the conference room hallway. nute : they must be dead by now. blast, what's left of them. the hologram fades off, as a battle droid, owo-1, cautiously opens the door. a deadly green cloud billows from the room. battle droids cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. it is tc-14 , carrying the tray of drinks. tc14 : oh, excuse me, so sorry. the protocol droid passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several battle droids before they can fire. int. federation battleship - bridge the bridge is a cocophony of alarms. nute and rune watch owo-1 on the viewscreen. owo-1 : not sure exactly what... owo-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. rune gives nute a worried look. nute : what in blazes is going on down there? rune : have you ever encountered a jedi knight before, sir? nute : well, not exactly, but i don't...(panicked) seal off the bridge. rune : that won't be enough, sir. the doors to the bridge slam shut. nute : i want destroyer droids up here at once!!! rune : we will not survive this. int. federation battleship - hallway - outside bridge qui-gon cuts several battle droids in half, creating a shower of sparks and metal parts. obi-wan raises his hand, sending several battle droids crashing into the wall. qui-gon makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it. int. federation battleship - bridge the crew is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door. qui-gon and obi-wan are on the view screen. nute : close the blast doors!!! the huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a third. there is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. qui-gon tabs the door with his sword. the screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door. rune : ...they're still coming through! on the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away. nute : impossible!! this is impossible!! rune : where are those destroyer droids?! int. federation battleship - hallway - outside bridge ten ugly destroyer wheel droids roll down the hallway at full speed. just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration. qui-gon can't see them but senses their presence. qui-gon : destroyer droids! obi-wan : offhand, i'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage. the wheel droids, led by p-59, rush the entry area from three hallways, blasting away with their laser guns. they stop firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears. obi-wan and qui-gon are nowhere to be seen. p-59 : switch to bio...there they are! the jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut. the wheel droids blast away at the two jedi with their laser swords. obi-wan : they have shield generators! qui-gon : it's a standoff! let's go! int. federation battleship - bridge nute and rune stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the wheel droids' pov speeds to the doorway. rune : we have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids. tey how : sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft. int. federation battleship - main bay qui-gon and obi-wan appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. they are careful not to be seen. thousands of battle droids are loading onto landing craft. qui-gon : battle droids. obi-wan : it's an invisible army. qui-gon : it's an odd play for the trade federation. we've got to warn the naboo and contact chancellor valorum. let's split up. stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet. obi-wan : you were right about one thing, master. the negotiations were short. int. federation battleship - bridge tey how recieves a transmission. tey how : sir, a transmission from the planet. rune : it's queen amidala herself. nute : at last we're getting results. on the view screen, queen amidala appears in her throne room. wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the governing council and four handmaidens, eirtae, yane, rabe, and sache. nute : (cont'd) again you come before me, your highness. the federation is pleased. amidala : you will not be pleased when you hear what i have to say, viceroy...your trade boycott of our planet has ended. nute smirks at rune. nute : i was not aware of such a failure. amidala : i have word that the senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours. nute : i take it you know the outcome. i wonder why they bother to vote. amidala : enough of this pretense, viceroy! i'm aware the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement. nute : i know nothing about any ambassadors...you must be mistaken. amidala, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully. amidala : beware, viceroy....the federation is going too far this time. nute : your highness, we would never do anything without the approval of the senate. you assume too much. amidala : we will see. the queen fades off, and the view screen goes black. rune : she's right, the senate will never.... nute : it's too late now. rune : do you think she suspects an attack? nute : i don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there. int. naboo palace - throne room the queen, eirtae, sache and her governor, sio bibble, stand before a hologram of senator palpatine, a thin, kindly man. palpatine : ...how could that be true?

qui-gon : relax. qui-gon puts his hand on jar jar's shoulder. jar jar relaxes into a coma. obi-wan : you overdid it. the colo claw fish leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the sando aqua monster. obi-wan (cont'd) this is not good! jar jar regains consciousness. jar jar : wesa dead yet?? oie boie! jar jar's eyes bulge, and he faints again. the sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the aqua monster. the colo claw fish chasing them isn't so lucky. it is munched in half by the larger predator. the little sub slips away. qui-gon : head for that outcropping. ext. theed - main road into theed - day (fx) the long columns of the droid army move down the main road leading to theed, the naboo capital. ext. theed plaza - day (fx) as the queen watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying nute and rune lands in theed plaza. they exit the transport. nute : ah, victory! int. naboo lake - underwater - sub (fx) the little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit. jar jar : wesa dude it! ext. theed - estuary - day paradise. billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. there is a loud rush of bubbles, and a small sub bobs to the surface. the current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river. obi-wan switches off the two remaining bubble canopies. qui-gon stands up to look around. jar jar lets out a sigh of relief. jar jar : wesa safe now. qui-gon : get this thing started. jar jar : dissen berry good. hey? obi-wan : what is it? jar jar looks back to where they're drifting. he sees they are headed for a huge waterfall. jar jar : what!!?? oie boie! obi-wan tries to start the engine. the long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate. obi-wan struggles until finally, a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current. the sub slowly moves forward. in the background, qui-gon takes a cable out of his belt. the engine coughs and dies. they start drifting backward again. jar jar panics. jar jar : (cont'd) iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey! qui-gon shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore. the sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall. qui-gon : come on... obi-wan climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. qui-gon starts in after him. qui-gon : (cont'd) come on, jar jar. jar jar : no! too scary! obi-wan : get up here! jar jar : no a mighty no! jar jar looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall. jar jar : (cont'd) oie boie...mesa comen. mesa comen! jar jar starts to climb out of the sub. obi-wan is on shore and helps to pull qui-gon out of the water. obi-wan : that was close. battle droid 3b3 : (o.s) drop your weapons! the two jedi turn around to see a battle droid standing in front of them. jar jar climbs up on shore between the jedi. battle droid 3b3 : i said drop your weapons qui-gon ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the droid is cut down by the jedi. a stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall. the jedi move on. jar jar reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess. jar jar : whoa!!! ext. theed - palace - day the waterfalls of theed sparkle in the noonday sun. int. theed - palace throne room - day queen amidala, sio bibble, and five of her handmaidens (eirtae, yane, padme, rabe, sache) are surrounded by twenty droids. captain panaka and four naboo guards are also held at gunpoint. nute and rune stand in the middle of the room. bibble : ...how will you explain this invasion to the senate? nute : the naboo and the federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. i've been assured it will be ratified by the senate. amidala : i will not co-operate. nute : now, now, your highness. you are not going to like what we have in store for your people. in time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. commander.

(looking around)this is a strange world to me. anakin studies her intently. anakin : you are a strange girl to me. jar jar pushes the nose on what appears to be a little droid, and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around, knocking over everything. jar jar hold on but can't stop it. anakin : (cont'd) hit the nose! jar jar hits the nose, and the droid collapses back into its original state. anakin and padme laugh. anakin watches padme straighten her hair. ext. watto's junk yard - behind shop - day watto reads a small portable monitor he is holding. he stands before a hyperdrive. watto : ...here it is...a t-14 hyperdrive generator!! thee in luck, i'm the only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. it would be cheaper, i think...sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this? qui-gon : i have 20,000 republic dataries. watto : republic credits?!? republic credits are no good out here. i need something more real... qui-gon : i don't have anything else.

(you!!) jar jar : who, mesa?? sebulba : (subtitled) ni chuba na?? (is this yours??) sebulba holds the frog up to the gungan threateningly. several other creatures start to gather. sebulba shoves jar jar to the ground. the gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety. jar jar : (to himself) why mesa always da one?? anakin : (v.o) because you're afraid. jar jar turns to see anakni pushing his way next to him. the boy stands up to sebulba in a very self-assured way. anakin : (subtitled) chess ko, sebulba...coo wolpa tooney rana.

Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
luke skywalker has returned to his home planet of tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend han solo from the clutches of the�vile gangster jabba the hutt. little does luke know that the galactic empire has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded death star. when completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy... pan down to reveal a monstrous half-completed death star, its massive superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of a giant octopus. beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of endor. an imperial star destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored space station, followed by two zipping tie fighters. a small imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the death star. 2 int imperial shuttle - cockpit the shuttle captain makes contact with the death star. shuttle captain command station, this is st 321. code clearance blue. we're starting our approach. deactivate the security shield. death star controller (filtered vo) the security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. stand by... you are clear to proceed. shuttle captain we're starting our approach. 3 int death star - control room operators move about among the control panels. a shield operator hits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the death star, the moon endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible deflector shield. a control officer rushes over to the shield operator. officer inform the commander that lord vader's shuttle has arrived. operator yes, sir. the control officer moves to a view port and watches as the imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. a squad of imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft. 4 int death star - main docking bay the death star commander, moff jerjerrod, a tall, confident technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. the troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. but the death star commander stands arrogantly tall. the exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a whoosh, revealing only darkness. then, heavy footsteps and mechanical breathing. from this black void appears darth vader, lord of the sith. vader looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp. jerjerrod lord vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. we're honored by your presence. vader you may dispense with the pleasantries, commander. i'm here to put you back on schedule. the commander turns ashen and begins to shake. jerjerrod i assure you, lord vader, my men are working as fast as they can. vader perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them. jerjerrod i tell you, this station will be operational as planned. vader the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. jerjerrod but he asks the impossible. i need more men. vader then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. jerjerrod (aghast) the emperor's coming here? vader that is correct, commander. and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. jerjerrod we shall double our efforts. vader i hope so, commander, for your sake. the emperor is not as forgiving as i am. 5 ext road to jabba's palace - tatooine a lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate tatooine terrain. we hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive reply before catching sight of artoo-detoo and see-threepio, making their way along the road toward the ominous palace of jabba the hutt. threepio of course i'm worried. and you should be, too. lando calrissian and poor chewbacca never returned from this awful place. artoo whistles timidly. threepio don't be so sure. if i told you half the things i've heard about this jabba the hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. the two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace. threepio artoo, are you sure this is the right place? i better knock, i suppose. 6 ext jabba's palace - gate threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly knocks on the iron door. threepio (instantly) there doesn't seem to be anyone there. let's go back and tell master luke. a small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects the two droids. strange voice tee chuta hhat yudd! threepio goodness gracious me! threepio points to artoo, then to himself. threepio artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka jabba du hutt. the eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the eye zips back into the door. the hatch slams shut. artoo beeps his concern. threepio i don't think they're going to let us in, artoo. we'd better go. artoo beeps his reluctance as threepio turns to leave. suddenly the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic screech. the robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. the droids look at one another, afraid to enter. artoo starts forward into the gloom. threepio rushes after his stubby companion. the door lowers noisily behind them. threepio artoo, wait. oh, dear! artoo. artoo, i really don't think we should rush into all this. artoo continues down the corridor, with threepio following. threepio oh, artoo! artoo, wait for me! 7 int jabba's palace - hallway the door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway. the frightened robots are met by two giant, green gamorrean guards, who fall in behind them. threepio glances quickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to artoo. one guard grunts an order. artoo beeps nervously. threepio just you deliver master luke's message and get us out of here. oh my! oh! oh, no. walking toward them out of the darkness is bib fortuna, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull. bib die wanna wanga! threepio oh, my! die wanna wauaga. we -- we bring a message to your master, jabba the hutt. artoo lets out a series of quick beeps. threepio (cont) ...and a gift. (thinks a moment, then to artoo) gift, what gift? bib shakes his head negatively. bib nee jabba no badda. me chaade su goodie. bib holds out his hand toward artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. threepio turns to the strange-looking alien. threepio he says that our instructions are to give it only to jabba himself. bib thinks about this for a moment. threepio i'm terribly sorry. i'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. bib gestures for the droids to follow. bib nudd chaa. the droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed by the two guards. threepio artoo, i have a bad feeling about this. 8 int jabba's throne room the throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque creatures ever conceived in the universe. artoo and threepio seem very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as bib fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating crowd: jabba the hutt. the monarch of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named oola. at the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, salacious crumb. bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. jabba laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. threepio bows politely. threepio good morning. jabba bo shuda! the robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned villain. threepio the message, artoo, the message. artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a hologram of luke on the floor. the image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young jedi towers over the space gangsters. luke greetings, exalted one. allow me to introduce myself. i am luke skywalker, jedi knight and friend to captain solo. i know that you are powerful, mighty jabba, and that your anger with solo must be equally powerful. i seek an audience with your greatness to bargain for solo's life. (jabba's crowd laughs) with your wisdom, i'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. as a token of my goodwill, i present to you a gift: these two droids. threepio is startled by this announcement. threepio what did he say? luke (cont) ... both are hardworking and will serve you well. threepio this can't be! artoo, you're playing the wrong message. luke's hologram disappears. jabba laughs while bib speaks to him in huttese. jabba (in huttese subtitled) there will be no bargain. threepio we're doomed. jabba (in huttese subtitled) i will not give up my favorite decoration. i like captain solo where he is. jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a carbonized han solo. threepio artoo, look! captain solo. and he's still frozen in carbonite. 9 int dungeon corridor one of jabba's gamorrean guards marches artoo and threepio down a dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. the cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. artoo beeps pitifully. threepio what could possibly have come over master luke. is it something i did? he never expressed any unhappiness with my work. oh! oh! hold it! ohh! a large tentacle wraps around threepio's neck. he manages to break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor. 10 int boiler room the door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy machinery. the guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named ev-9d9. behind the robot can be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid. a second power droid is upside down. as smoking branding irons are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized electronic scream. artoo and threepio cringe as the guard grunts to ev- 9d9. ninedenine ah, good. new acquisitions. you are a protocol droid, are you not? threepio i am see-threepio, human-cy... ninedenine yes or no will do. threepio oh. well, yes. ninedenine how many languages do you speak? threepio i am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... ninedenine splendid! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. threepio disintegrated? ninedenine (to a gamorrean guard) guard! this protocol droid might be useful. fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to his excellency's main audience chamber. the guard shoves threepio toward the door. threepio (disappearing) artoo, don't leave me! ohhh! artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. then he beeps angrily. ninedenine you're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. i have need for you on the master's sail barge. and i think you'll fit in nicely. the poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured electronic scream. 11 int jabba's throne room the court of jabba the hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous party. sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as oola and a fat female dancer perform in front of jabba's throne. jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons oola to come and sit with him. she stops dancing and backs away, shaking her head. jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him. jabba da eitha! the lovely alien shakes her head again and screams. oola na chuba negatorie na! na! natoota... jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain. jabba boscka! he pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the floor springs open and swallows her up. as the door snaps shut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. jabba and his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her fate through a grate. threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of han solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.�an unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. on the far side of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards followed by boushh, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his captive, han solo's copilot, chewbacca the wookiee. bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into his ear, pointing at chewbacca and the bounty hunter. jabba listens intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (ubese). boushh (in ubese subtitled) i have come for the bounty on this wookiee. threepio oh, no! chewbacca! jabba (in huttese subtitled) at last we have the mighty chewbacca. jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to threepio, waving him closer. the reluctant droid obeys. threepio oh, uh, yes, uh, i am here, your worshipfulness. uh... yes! jabba continues speaking, as threepio nervously translates. boushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. he notices boba fett standing near the door. threepio oh. the illustrious jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. boushh (in ubese subtitled) i want fifty thousand. no less. jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. boushh adjusts his weapon as jabba raves in huttese and threepio struggles back onto the throne. the disheveled droid tries to compose himself. threepio uh, oh... but what, what did i say? (to boushh) uh, the mighty jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. the bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. threepio looks at it, then looks at jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. the droid is very nervous and jabba is getting very impatient. threepio because he's holding a thermal detonator. the guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the room. jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. the room has fallen into a tense hush. jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh. jabba (in huttese subtitled) this bounty hunter is my kind of scum. fearless and inventive. jabba continues. threepio jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. and i suggest you take it. bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction. boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead. boushh zeebuss. threepio he agrees! the raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. chewbacca growls. as he is led away we spot lando calrissian, disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask. the band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures. boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room. boba fett is watching him. boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. boba fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance. 12 int dungeon corridor and cell gamorrean guards lead chewie down the same hallway we saw before. when a tentacle reaches out at the wookiee, chewie's ferocious roar echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. it takes all the guards to hurl chewie roughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door. 13 ext jabba's palace the palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. on the road in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction. 14 int jabba's throne room - night silence. the room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly. a shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of the room and is revealed to be boushh, the bounty hunter. he picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters. han solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his coffin-like case suspended by a force field. the bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of the coffin. the heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove. boushh steps up to the case, studying han, and then turns to the controls on the side of the coffin. he activates a series of switches and, after one last hesitant look at han, slides the de-carbonization lever. the case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the contours of han's face begins to melt away. the bounty hunter watches as han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. his face muscles relax from their mask of horror. he appears quite dead. boushh's ugly helmet leans close to han's face listening for the breath of life. nothing. he waits. han's eyes pop open with a start and he begins coughing. the bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn. boushh just relax for a moment. you're free of the carbonite. han touches his face with his hand and moans. boushh shhh. you have hibernation sickness. han i can't see. boushh your eyesight will return in time. han where am i? boushh jabba's palace. han who are you? the bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, revealing the beautiful face of princess leia. leia someone who loves you. han leia! leia i gotta get you out of here. as leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is pierced by an obscene huttese cackle from the other side of the alcove. han what's that? i know that laugh. the curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing jabba the hutt, surrounded by bib and other aliens. he laughs again, and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee. han hey, jabba. look, jabba, i was just on my way to pay you back, but i got a little sidetracked. it's not my fault. jabba laughs. jabba (in huttese subtitled) it's too late for that, solo. you may have been a good smuggler, but now you're bantha fodder. han look... jabba (cont huttese subtitled) take him away! the guards grab han and start to lead him away. han jabba... i'll pay you triple! you're throwing away a fortune here. don't be a fool! han is dragged off, as lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead leia away. jabba (in huttese subtitled) bring her to me. jabba chuckles as lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young princess toward him. threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly turns away in disgust. leia we have powerful friends. you're gonna regret this... jabba (in huttese subtitled) i'm sure. inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of jabba's ugly blob of a head, and leia turns away in disgust. leia ugh! threepio ohhh, i can't bear to watch. 15 int dungeon cell the heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. a guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack in the door. han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell. he jumps back against the cell door and listens. han chewie? chewie, is that you? the shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward han, lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, revealing chewie. han ah! chew--chewie! the giant wookiee barks with glee. han wait. i can't see, pal. what's goin' on? chewie barks an excited blue streak. han luke? luke's crazy. he can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. chewie barks a reply. han a...jedi knight? i--i'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. chewie growls insistently. he holds han to his chest and pets his head. han i'm all right, pal. i'm all right. 16 int main gate and hall - jabba's palace noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding light and reveal the silhouetted figure of luke skywalker. he is clad in a robe similar to ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. luke strides purposefully into the hallway. two giant guards move to block luke's path. luke halts. luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately lower their spears and fall back. the young jedi lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway. bib fortuna appears out of the gloom. he speaks to luke as they approach each other, but luke doesn't stop and bib must reverse his direction and hurry alongside the young jedi in order to carry on the conversation. several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness. luke i must speak with jabba. bib answers in huttese, shaking his head in denial. luke stops and stares at bib; he raises his hand slightly. luke you will take me to jabba now! bib turns in hypnotic response to luke's command, and luke follows him into the gloom. luke you serve your master well. bib responds. luke and you will be rewarded. 17 int jabba's throne room jabba is asleep on his throne, with leia lying in front of him. salacious sits by jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. leia is now dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, jabba the hutt. threepio stands behind jabba as bib comes up to the gangster slug. threepio at last! master luke's come to rescue me. bib master. jabba awakens with a start and bib continues, in huttese. bib ...luke skywalker, jedi knight. jabba (in huttese subtitled) i told you not to admit him. luke i must be allowed to speak. bib (in huttese subtitled) he must be allowed to speak. jabba, furious, clobbers bib and shoves him away. jabba (in huttese subtitled) you weak-minded fool! he's using an old jedi mind trick. luke stares hard at jabba. luke you will bring captain solo and the wookiee to me. jabba (in huttese subtitled) your mind powers will not work on me, boy. luke nevertheless, i'm taking captain solo and his friends. you can either profit by this... or be destroyed! it's your choice. but i warn you not to underestimate my powers. jabba's laugh is mean and loud. threepio attempts to warn luke about the pit. threepio master luke, you're standing on... jabba (in huttese subtitled) there will be no bargain, young jedi. i shall enjoy watching you die. luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies into luke's hand. the bewildered guard grabs for it as jabba raises his hand. jabba bascka! the floor suddenly drops away, sending luke and the hapless guard into the pit. the pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. leia starts forward but is restrained by a human guard-- lando, recognizable behind his mask. she looks at him and he shakes his head "no." 18 int rancor pit luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the dungeonlike cage. luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically for help. a crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to rumble open. the guard screams in panic. luke looks calmly around for a means of escape. threepio oh, no! the rancor! at the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged rancor emerges. the guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top. the hideous beast closes in on him. the rancor moves past luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. a few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. the audience cheers and laughs at the guard's fate. the monster turns and starts for luke. the young jedi dashes away just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of an earlier victim. the monster grabs luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth. at the last moment, luke wedges the bone in the monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. the monster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an avalanche. the monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees luke, who squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. luke looks past the monster to the holding cave beyond. on the far side of the holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. the rancor spots luke and reaches into the crevice for him. luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the rancor's finger. 19 holding tunnel - rancor pit the rancor lets out a loud howl as luke makes a run for the holding cave. he reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. when he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner. luke turns to see the monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. the guards move to the gate and start poking at the young jedi with spears, laughing. luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for him. suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. as the rancor moves in for the kill, luke picks up a skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel. the giant overhead door comes crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg. a startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. there's consternation at this turn of events. heads look to jabba, who is actually turning red with anger. leia cannot suppress her joy. jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off. jabba (in huttese subtitled) bring me solo and the wookiee. they will all suffer for this outrage. 21 int rancor pit the rancor keepers have come into the cage and are examining their dead beast. one of them breaks down and weeps. the other glares menacingly at luke, who is unworried. several guards rush into the holding tunnel and take luke away. 22 int throne room the crowd of creepy courtiers parts as han and chewie are brought into the throne room, and other guards drag luke up the steps. luke han! han luke! luke are you all right? han fine. together again, huh? luke wouldn't miss it. han how are we doing? luke the same as always. han that bad, huh? where's leia? luke looks to leia. leia i'm here. threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes leia like a pet cat. several of the guards, including lando, bring luke from the other side of the room. boba is standing behind jabba. threepio steps forward and translates for the captives. threepio oh, dear. his high exaltedness, the great jabba the hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. han good, i hate long waits. threepio you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful sarlacc. han (to luke) doesn't sound so bad. threepio in his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. han on second thought, let's pass on that, huh? chewie barks his agreement. luke you should have bargained, jabba. that's the last mistake you'll ever make. jabba cackles evilly at this. as the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer rises from the crowd. leia and chewie exchange concerned looks, but luke skywalker, jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile. 23 ext tatooine sea - skiff jabba's huge sail barge moves above the desert surface accompanied by two smaller skiffs. one of the skiffs glides close, revealing luke, han, and chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is lando in disguise. han i think my eyes are getting better. instead of a big dark blur, i see a big light blur. luke there's nothing to see. i used to live here, you know. han you're gonna die here, you know. convenient. luke just stick close to chewie and lando. i've taken care of everything. han oh... great! 24 int barge observation deck jabba the hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. his entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. jabba (in huttese subtitled) soon you will learn to appreciate me. threepio wanders among the sail barge aliens, bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. the stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. threepio oh, i'm terribly sor... artoo! what are you doing here? artoo beeps a quick reply. threepio well, i can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. they're going to execute master luke and, if we're not careful, us too! artoo whistles a singsong response. threepio hmm. i wish i had your confidence. 25 ext sarlacc pit the convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. the sail barge stops to one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. but the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. at the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. this is the sarlacc. a plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. guards release luke's bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the sarlacc's mouth. 26 ext sail barge observation deck jabba and leia are now by the rail, watching. threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. as threepio steps up to a comlink, jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. threepio victims of the almighty sarlacc: his excellency hopes that you will die honorably. but should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great jabba the hutt will now listen to your pleas. 27 ext skiff han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak. han threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. right? chewie growls his agreement. luke jabba! this is your last chance. free us or die. lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him. 28 int sail barge observation deck the assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as artoo zips unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. jabba's laughter subsides as he speaks into the comlink. jabba (in huttese subtitled) move him into position. jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. leia looks worried. 29 ext barge - upper deck artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. below, in the skiff, luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping sarlacc. luke looks up at artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. a flap opens in artoo's domed head. jabba (in huttese subtitled) put him in. 30 ext skiff - plank luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators. but, before anyone can even perceive what is happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his fingertips. the plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him skyward. in midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. he casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which artoo has sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand. with samurai speed, luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. the other guards swarm toward luke. he wades into them, lightsaber flashing. lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff. 31 ext sarlacc pit a bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and begins sliding. he claws desperately as a sarlacc tentacle grabs him and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth. 32 int sail barge jabba watches this and explodes in rage. he barks commands, and the guards around him rush off to do his bidding. the scuzzy creatures watching the action from the window are in an uproar. 33 ext skiff luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of the sarlacc. he starts to untie chewie's bonds. luke easy, chewie. at that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts from a big cannon on the upper deck. lando is tossed from the deck of the rocking skiff. he manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately above the sarlacc pit. lando whoa! whoa! help! 34 ext upper deck - sail barge with two swift strides, the dangerous boba fett ignites his rocket pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff. 35 ext skiff boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at luke, who has freed han and chewie from their bonds. but before boba can fire, the young jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter's gun in half. immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck gun. shards of skiff deck fly. chewie and han are thrown against the rail. han chewie, you okay? where is he? the wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain. han i'm okay, pal. for a moment, luke is distracted, and in that moment, boba fires a cable out of his armored sleeve. instantly, luke is wrapped in a strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from the wrist down. luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. luke shrugs away the cable and stands free. another blast from the barge's deck gun hits near boba and he is knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where lando is hanging. lando han! chewie? han lando! luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him. the second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves in on luke fast. luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. the young jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst. chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to han, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. han searches the deck as chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold of the spear. boba fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. he looks over at the other skiff, where luke is whipping a mass of guards. boba raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage. chewie barks desperately at han. han boba fett?! boba fett?! where? the space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand whacks squarely in the middle of boba's rocket pack. the impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. boba blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the side of the huge sail barge and sliding away into the pit. he screams as his armored body makes its last flight past lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the sarlacc. the sarlacc burps. chewie growls a weak congratulations to han. 36 int sail barge leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto jabba's throne, and throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous neck. then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the chain violently in her grasp. jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath the tightening chain. his huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his scum-coated tongue flops out. the exalted hutt's huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. leia struggles to free herself of her bondage. 37 ext skiff luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as han extends his spear downward to lando, who is still dangling precariously from a rope on the prisoner's skiff. han lando, grab it! lando lower it! han i'm trying! a major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. the rope breaks, and lando falls to the side of the sarlacc pit. luckily, han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above lando and the pit. the wounded wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently. han whoa! whoa! grab me, chewie! i'm slipping. chewie grabs hold of han's feet, holding him upside down, as han extends the spear toward lando, who is clutching to the side of the pit. han grab it! l--lando. grab! luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. he sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. luke leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the sail barge. barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head. with jedi agility, luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit. the injured chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate lando. the baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the sarlacc pit by lying very still. every time he tries to reach for han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward. han grab it! almost... you almost got it! another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing lando to let go of the spear. lando hold it! whoa! again han extends the spear toward lando. han gently now. all... all right. now easy, easy. hold me, chewie. lando screams. one of the sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit. han chewie! chewie, give me the gun. don't move, lando. lando no, wait! i thought you were blind! han it's all right. trust me. don't move. lando all right! a little higher! just a little higher! han adjusts his aim as lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate fires at the tentacle. direct hit. the tentacle releases lando, and chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff. han chewie, pull us up! come on! okay... up, chewie, up! 38 ext upper deck the deck gunners have chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. the deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young jedi has demolished them. immediately, luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him, firing their laser pistols. 39 int sail barge - observation deck leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as artoo zips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart. leia come on. we gotta get out of here quick. artoo and leia race for the exit, passing threepio, who is kicking and screaming as salacious crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out one of the golden droid's eyes. threepio not my eyes! artoo, help! quickly, artoo. oh! ohhh! you beast! artoo zips over and zaps salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, crashing into the rafters as artoo, leia, and threepio (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off. 40 ext upper deck - sail barge luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by guards and fighting like a demon. leia emerges onto the deck as luke turns to face another guard. luke (to leia) get the gun! point it at the deck! leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels the gun around. luke point it at the deck! a laser blast hits luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards. he looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. he flexes the hand; it still works. near the rail of the upper deck, artoo and threepio steady themselves as threepio gets ready to jump. artoo beeps wildly. threepio artoo, where are we going? i couldn't possibly jump. artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, tumbling toward the sand. luke runs along the empty deck toward leia and the barge gun, which she has brought around to point down at the deck. luke come on! luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. he gathers leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. the gun explodes into the deck as luke and leia swing out toward the skiff. 41 ext skiff han leans panting against the rail as chewie helps lando onto the deck. luke and leia land on the skiff with flair. luke let's go! and don't forget the droids. lando we're on our way. the sail barge is exploding in stages in the distance. half of the huge craft is on fire. 42 ext sand dune threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. next to it, artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. the skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. with a loud clang, both droids are pulled from the sand. 43 ext dune sea the little skiff skips around the burning sail barge, which continues its chain of explosions. as the skiff sails off across the desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration. 44 ext dune sea - landing area a ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. then, through the roar, we hear the voices of our heroes. they emerge slowly from the veil of sand, pressing on against the wind. first come artoo and threepio, followed by leia guiding han, then luke and lando come into view, each supporting one side of the towering chewbacca, who hobbles from his wound. soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. it is the millennium falcon and, parked beside it, luke's trusty x-wing and a two-seated y-wing. they must shout to be heard. han i don't know. all i can see is a lot of blowing sand! leia that's all any of us can see. han (blinking) then i guess i'm getting better. as soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the falcon, the wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a hum. han (turning to luke) i've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there. luke (shrugging it off) i had a lot of help. think nothing of it. han no, i'm thinking a lot about it. that carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. and it wasn't just sleepin'. it was a big wide awake nothing! luke nods, as chewie growls affectionately at the young jedi warrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. and leia warmly hugs him. luke (moving to his ship) i'll see you back at the fleet. han why don't you leave that crate and come with us? luke i have a promise i have to keep first... to an old friend. luke and artoo take off in their spacecraft. han (looking dubiously at lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) guess i owe you some thanks, too, lando. lando figured if i left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. leia he means "you're welcome." lando come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball. 44a ext space above tatooine the desolate yellow planet fills the screen, luke's x-wing appears and peels off to the left. a moment later, the falcon appears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the camera. 45 int x-wing - cockpit luke is at the controls, with artoo attached behind him outside the canopy. luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the millennium falcon. luke i'll meet you back at the fleet. leia (over comlink) hurry. the alliance should be assembled by now. luke i will. han (over comlink) hey, luke, thanks. thanks for comin' after me. now i owe you one. a message from artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of luke. he smiles at the monitor and speaks to artoo, as he pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand. luke that's right, artoo. we're going to the dagobah system. i have a promise to keep... to an old friend. 46 ext space - death star and endor a super star destroyer and several ships of the imperial fleet rest in space above the half-completed death star and its green neighbor, endor. four squads of tie fighters escort an imperial shuttle toward the death star. 47 int death star - corridor to docking bay lord vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous death star commander. 48 int docking bay - death star thousands of imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth docking bay. vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where the shuttle is coming to rest. the shuttle's ramp lowers and the emperor's royal guards come out and create a lethal perimeter. the assembled troops move to rigid attention with a momentous snap. then, in the huge silence which follows, the emperor appears. he is a rather small, shriveled old man. his bent frame slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. he wears a hooded cloak similar to the one ben wears, except that it is black. the emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow eyes. commander jerjerrod and darth vader kneel to him. the supreme ruler of the galaxy beckons to the dark lord. emperor (to vader) rise, my friend. vader rises and falls in next to the emperor as he slowly makes his way along the rows of troops. jerjerrod and the other commanders stay kneeling until the supreme ruler and vader, followed by several imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the procession. vader the death star will be completed on schedule. emperor you have done well, lord vader. and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker. vader yes, my master. emperor patience, my friend. in time he will seek you out. and when he does, you must bring him before me. he has grown strong. only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force. vader as you wish. emperor everything is proceeding as i have foreseen. he laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of imperial troops. 49 ext yoda's house - dagobah once again, artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. he beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at yoda's cottage. warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom. 50 int yoda's house the tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of the cottage. our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of yoda, the jedi master. his manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker. yoda hmm. that face you make. look i so old to young eyes? luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been woeful. caught, he tries to hide it. luke no... of course not. yoda (tickled, chuckles) i do, yes, i do! sick have i become. old and weak. (points a crooked finger) when nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. hmm? yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed. yoda soon will i rest. yes, forever sleep. earned it, i have. yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort. luke master yoda, you can't die. yoda strong am i with the force... but not that strong! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. that is the way of things... the way of the force. luke but i need your help. i've come back to complete the training. yoda no more training do you require. already know you that which you need. yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed. luke then i am a jedi? yoda (shakes his head) ohhh. not yet. one thing remains: vader. you must confront vader. then, only then, a jedi will you be. and confront him you will. luke is in agony. he is silent for a long moment, screwing up his courage. finally he is able to ask. luke master yoda... is darth vader my father? yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. an odd, sad smile creases his face. he turns painfully on his side, away from luke. yoda mmm... rest i need. yes... rest. luke watches him, each moment an eternity. luke yoda, i must know. yoda your father he is. luke reacts as if cut. yoda told you, did he? luke yes. a new look of concern crosses yoda's face. he closes his eyes. yoda unexpected this is, and unfortunate... luke unfortunate that i know the truth? yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth. yoda (gathering all his strength) no. unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. not ready for the burden were you. luke well, i'm sorry. yoda remember, a jedi's strength flows from the force. but beware. anger, fear, aggression. the dark side are they. once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. he beckons the young jedi closer to him. yoda luke...luke...do not...do not underestimate the powers of the emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. luke, when gone am i (cough), the last of the jedi will you be. luke, the force runs strong in your family. pass on what you have learned, luke... (with great effort) there is...another...sky...sky...walker. he catches his breath. a shiver runs through the ancient green creature, and he dies. luke stares at his dead master as he disappears in front of his eyes. 51 ext dagobah swamp - x-wing luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. artoo beeps a greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. luke kneels down, begins to help artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly. luke i can't do it, artoo. i can't go on alone. ben (os) yoda will always be with you. luke looks up to see the shimmering image of ben kenobi. luke obi-wan! why didn't you tell me? the ghost of ben kenobi approaches him through the swamp. luke you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father. ben you father was seduced by the dark side of the force. he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader. when that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. so what i have told you was true... from a certain point of view. luke (turning away, derisive) a certain point of view! ben luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. luke is unresponsive. ben studies him in silence for a moment. ben i don't blame you for being angry. if i was wrong in what i did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. you see, what happened to your father was my fault. ben pauses sadly. ben anakin was a good friend. luke turns with interest at this. as ben speaks, luke settles on a stump, mesmerized. artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence. ben when i first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him. i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi. i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda. i was wrong. my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy. luke is entranced. luke there's still good in him. ben i also thought he could be turned back to the good side. it couldn't be done. he is more machine now than man. twisted and evil. luke i can't do it, ben. ben you cannot escape your destiny. luke i tried to stop him once. i couldn't do it. ben vader humbled you when first you met him, luke... but that experience was part of your training. it taught you, among other things, the value of patience. had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then, you could have finished your training here with yoda. you would have been prepared. luke but i had to help my friends. ben (grinning at luke's indignation) and did you help them? it was they who had to save you. you achieved little by rushing back prematurely, i fear. luke (with sadness) i found out darth vader was my father. ben to be a jedi, luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. you're no longer so reckless now, luke. you are strong and patient. and now, you must face darth vader again! luke i can't kill my own father. ben then the emperor has already won. you were our only hope. luke yoda spoke of another. ben the other he spoke of is your twin sister. luke but i have no sister. ben hmm. to protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. the emperor knew, as i did, if anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. luke leia! leia's my sister. ben your insight serves you well. bury your feelings deep down, luke. they do you credit. but they could be made to serve the emperor. luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this. ben (continuing his narrative) when your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. your mother and i knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine... and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa, on alderaan. luke turns, and settles near ben to hear the tale. ben (attempting to give solace with his words) the organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. but it was a title without real power, since alderaan had long been a democracy. even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. that's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire. and because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause. that's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his sister. luke but you can't let her get involved now, ben. vader will destroy her. ben she hasn't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have, luke... but the force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. there is no avoiding the battle. you must face and destroy vader! 52 ext space - rebel fleet the vast rebel fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. overhead a dozen small corellian battleships fly in formation. fighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the rebel star cruisers, the headquarters frigate. 53 int headquarters frigate - main briefing room hundreds of rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in the war room. wedge is among them. in the center of the room is a holographic model depicting the half-completed imperial death star, the nearby moon of endor, and the protecting deflector shield. mon mothma, the leader of the alliance, enters the room. she is a stern but beautiful woman in her fifties. conferring with her are several military leaders, including general madine and admiral ackbar (a salmon-colored mon calamari). lando moves through the crowd until he finds han and chewie, standing next to leia and the two droids. han peers at lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused. han well, look at you, a general, huh? lando oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab. han (sarcastic) well, don't look at me, pal. i just said you were a fair pilot. i didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. lando (smiling) i'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. han well, who says they didn't. but i ain't crazy. you're the respectable one, remember? mon mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent. mon mothma the emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. this causes a stir. mon mothma turns to a holographic model of the death star, the endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the center of the room. mon mothma the data brought to us by the bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the emperor's new battle station. we also know that the weapon systems of this death star are not yet operational. with the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. but most important of all, we've learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star. a volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. han turns to leia as chewie barks his amazement. mon mothma (cont) many bothans died to bring us this information. admiral ackbar, please. admiral ackbar steps forward and points to the death star's force field and the moon of endor. ackbar you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor. although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational, the death star does have a strong defense mechanism. it is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor. the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. there's a concerned murmur. ackbar (cont) general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack han turns to lando with a look of respect. han good luck. lando nods his thanks. han you're gonna need it. ackbar general madine. madine moves center stage. general madine we have stolen a small imperial shuttle. disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. the assembly begins to mumble among themselves. threepio sounds dangerous. leia (to han) i wonder who they found to pull that off. general madine general solo, is your strike team assembled? leia, startled, looks up at han, surprise changing to admiration. han uh, my team's ready. i don't have a command crew for the shuttle. chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers. han looks up at him. han well, it's gonna be rough, pal. i didn't want to speak for you. chewie waves that off with a huge growl. han (smiles) that's one. leia uh, general... count me in. voice (os) i'm with you, too! they turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more cheers. the commanders part, and there at the back stands luke. han and leia are surprised and delighted. leia moves to luke and embraces him warmly. she senses a change in him and looks into his eyes questioningly. leia what is it? luke (hesitant) ask me again sometime. han, chewie, and lando crowd around luke as the assembly breaks up. han luke. luke hi, han... chewie. artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried threepio. threepio "exciting" is hardly the word i would use. 54 int headquarters frigate - main docking bay the millennium falcon rests beyond the stolen imperial shuttle, which looks anomalous among all the rebel ships in the vast docking bay. chewie barks a final farewell to lando and leads artoo and threepio up the shuttle, crowded now with the rebel strike team loading weapons and supplies. lando turns to face han. luke and leia have said their good- byes and start up the ramp. han look. i want you to take her. i mean it. take her. you need all the help you can get. she's the fastest ship in the fleet. lando all right, old buddy. you know, i know what she means to you. i'll take good care of her. she-she won't get a scratch. all right? han (looks at him warmly) right. i got your promise now. not a scratch. lando look, would you get going, you pirate. han and lando pause, then exchange salutes. lando good luck. han you, too. han goes up the ramp. lando watches him go and then slowly turns away. 55 int imperial shuttle - cockpit luke is working on a back control panel as han comes in and takes the pilot's seat. chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out all the imperial controls. han you got her warmed? luke yeah, she's comin' up. chewie growls a complaint. han no. i don't think the empire had wookiees in mind when they designed her, chewie. leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near luke. chewie barks and hits some switches. han's glance has stuck on something out the window: the millennium falcon. leia nudges him gently. leia hey, are you awake? han yeah, i just got a funny feeling. like i'm not gonna see her again. chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the falcon, too. leia puts a hand on han's shoulder. leia (softly) come on, general, let's move. han snaps back to life. han right. chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. ready, everybody? luke all set. threepio here we go again. han all right, hang on. 56 ext space - the rebel fleet the stolen imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the headquarters frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms off into space. 57 int emperor's throne room the converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at the far end. there the emperor sits in an elaborate control chair before a large window which looks out across the half-completed death star to the giant green moon of endor. darth vader, standing with other members of the imperial council, cautiously approaches his master. the ruler's back is to vader. after several tense moments, the emperor's chair rotates around to face him. vader what is thy bidding, my master? emperor send the fleet to the far side of endor. there it will stay until called for. vader what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust? emperor it is of no concern. soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us! your work here is finished, my friend. go out to the command ship and await my orders. vader yes, my master. vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the emperor walks toward the waiting council members. 58 ext space - death star - moon there is a great deal of imperial traffic in the area as construction proceeds on the death star. transports, tie fighters, and a few star destroyers move about. now the huge super star destroyer announces itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame. 59 int stolen imperial shuttle - cockpit han looks back at luke and leia as chewie flips several switches. through the viewscreen, the death star and the huge super star destroyer can be seen. han if they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, chewie. chewie growls his agreement. controller (over radio) we have you on our screen now. please identify. han shuttle tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. controller (over radio) shuttle tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. han transmission commencing. leia and chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed transmission begins. leia now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. han it'll work. it'll work. chewie whines nervously. luke stares at the huge super star destroyer that looms ever larger before them. luke vader's on that ship. han now don't get jittery, luke. there are a lot of command ships. keep your distance though, chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. chewie barks a question. han i don't know. fly casual. luke i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come. han it's your imagination, kid. come on. let's keep a little optimism here. chewie barks his worries as the super star destroyer grows larger out the window. 60 int vader's star destroyer - bridge lord vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the death star. now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. after a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where admiral piett is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen earlier. piett straightens at vader's approach. vader where is that shuttle going? piett (into comlink) shuttle tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? pilot voice (han) (filtered) parts and technical crew for the forest moon. the bridge commander looks to vader for a reaction. vader do they have a code clearance? piett it's an older code, sir, but it checks out. i was about to clear them. vader looks upward, as he senses luke's presence. piett shall i hold them? vader no. leave them to me. i will deal with them myself. piett (surprised) as you wish, my lord. (to controller) carry on. piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink. 61 int stolen imperial shuttle - cockpit the group waits tensely. han they're not goin' for it, chewie. controller (filtered) shuttle tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. follow your present course. everyone breaths a sigh of relief. everyone but luke, who looks worried. chewie barks. han okay! i told you it was gonna work. no problem. 62 ext space - stolen imperial shuttle - endor the stolen imperial shuttle moves off toward the green sanctuary moon. 63 ext forest landing site - endor the stolen imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees. on an adjacent hill, the helmeted rebel contingent makes its way up a steep trail. leia and han are slightly ahead of chewie and luke. the troops of the strike-team squad follow, with artoo and threepio bringing up the rear. artoo beeps. up ahead, chewie and leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. han and luke crawl up to take a look. threepio oh, i told you it was dangerous here. their pov. not far below them, two imperial scouts are wandering through bushes in the valley below. their two rocket bikes are parked nearby. leia shall we try and go around? han it'll take time. this whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, han, luke and chewie start quietly down. 64 ext forest clearing - campsite the four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far from the two imperial scouts. han chewie and i will take care of this. you stay here. luke quietly, there might be more of them out there. han (grins) hey... it's me. han and chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. luke and leia exchange smiles. han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout whirls, knocking han into a tree. the scout shouts for his companion. scout #1 go for help! go! the second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to crash into a tree. han and scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight. luke (sarcastic) great. come on. luke starts for the scuffle, followed by leia with her laser pistol drawn. as they run through the bushes, leia stops and points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied bike parked nearby. leia over there! two more of them! luke i see them. wait, leia! but leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. she starts it up and takes off as luke jumps on the bike behind her. luke (pointing to the controls) quick! jam their comlink. center switch! luke and leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees. han hey, wait! ahhh! he flips the remaining scout to the ground. 65 ext forest - the bike chase the two fleeing imperial scouts have a good lead as luke and leia pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets. luke move closer! leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer through a narrow gap in the trees. one of the bikes scrapes a tree, slowing the scout. luke get alongside that one! leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their steering vanes scrape noisily. luke leaps from his bike to the back of the scout's, grabs the imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. luke gains control of the bike and follows leia, who has pulled ahead. they tear off after the remaining scout. luke get him! the speeding chase passes two more imperial scouts. these two swing into pursuit, chasing luke and leia, firing away with their laser cannon. the two rebels look behind them just as luke's bike takes a glancing hit. luke (indicating the one ahead) keep on that one! i'll take these two! with leia shooting ahead, luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode. luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. it explodes against a tree trunk. the scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. luke keeps on his tail. far ahead, leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. now leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight. the scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. suddenly, leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. the scout's bike takes a glancing hit. leia moves in alongside him. the scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. before leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. the happy scout looks back at the explosion. but when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. he hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration. another part of the forest: luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. now luke moves up close. the scout responds by slamming his bike into luke's. a fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. the scout zips under. luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. when he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one. another big tree looms in luke's path. he reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. the two bikes come apart a second before luke's explodes against a tree. the scout sweeps out and circles back to find luke. luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. the scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut luke in half. at the last instant, luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. the scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire. 66 ext scout campsite - forest han, chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait anxiously in the clearing. artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. he beeps. threepio oh, general solo, somebody's coming. oh! han, chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons. luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. he's too tired to care. he plops himself down on a boulder and looks around. han luke! where's leia? luke (concerned) what? she didn't come back? han i thought she was with you. luke we got separated. luke and han exchange a silent, grim look. luke gets up wearily. luke hey, we better go look for her. han nods, and signals to a rebel officer. han take the squad ahead. we'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. luke come on, artoo. we'll need your scanners. luke, chewie, han, and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another. threepio don't worry, master luke. we know what to do. they move off into the woods. threepio (to artoo) and you said it was pretty here. ugh! 67 ext forest clearing - leia's crash site a strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view. the creature is an ewok, by the name of wicket. he seems somewhat puzzled, and prods leia with a spear. the princess groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high ewok. she tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled. the ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a defensive position. leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear. leia cut it out! she stands up, and the ewok quickly backs away. leia i'm not gonna hurt you. leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log. leia well, looks like i'm stuck here. trouble is, i don't know where here is. she puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from her fall. she looks over at the watchful little ewok and pats the log beside her. leia well, maybe you can help me. come on, sit down. wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. leia pats the log again. leia i promise i won't hurt you. now come here. more growls and squeaks from the little bear creature. leia all right. you want something to eat? she takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously toward leia, chattering in his squeaky ewok language. leia that's right. come on. hmmm? sniffing the food curiously, the ewok comes toward leia and sits on the log beside her. she takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps back, startled again. he runs along the log, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. leia holds out the helmet to him. leia look, it's a hat. it's not gonna hurt you. look. you're a jittery little thing, aren't you? reassured, wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming to investigate the helmet. suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to sniff the air. he looks around warily, whispering some ewokese warning to leia. leia what is it? suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log next to leia. leia and wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding behind it. leia holds her own laser gun ready, while wicket disappears underneath the log. another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the forest. then leia senses something and turns to find a large imperial scout standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. he reaches out his hand for her weapon. scout #l freeze! come on, get up! she hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage in front of the log. scout #1 go get your ride and take her back to base. scout #2 yes, sir. the second scout starts toward his bike, as wicket, crouched under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. the scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at wicket, puzzled. leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. she dives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. leia fires away and hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's bike, which flies end over end and explodes. the forest is quiet once more. wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards leia with�new respect. he mumbles his awe. leia hurries over, looking around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage. leia come on, let's get outta here. as they move into the foliage, wicket takes the lead. he shrieks and tugs at leia to follow him. 68 int death star - corridor to emperor's tower darth vader walks down the corridor to the emperor's tower and private elevator. the emperor's private guard steps in vader's path. guard halt! the emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment. vader (raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the force) the emperor will see me, now! guard (repeating vader's command) the emperor will see you, now. 69 int emperor's tower - throne room two red imperial guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens to reveal vader. vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. it appears to be empty. his footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. he waits, absolutely still. the emperor sits with his back to the dark lord. emperor i told you to remain on the command ship. vader a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor. emperor (no surprise) yes, i know. vader (after a beat) my son is with them. emperor (very cool) are you sure? vader i have felt him, my master. emperor strange, that i have not. i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, lord vader. vader knows what is being asked. vader they are clear, my master. emperor then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them. vader (skeptical) he will come to me? emperor i have foreseen it. his compassion for you will be his undoing. he will come to you and then you will bring him before me. vader (bows) as you wish. the dark lord strides out of the throne room. 70 ext forest clearing - leia's crash site han, luke, chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw leia. luke finds leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern. han (os) luke! luke! luke runs with the helmet to where han has found the charred wreckage of a speeder bike in the grass. threepio oh, master luke. luke there's two more wrecked speeders back there. and i found this. he tosses the helmet to han. threepio i'm afraid that artoo's sensors can find no trace of princess leia. han (gravely) i hope she's alright. chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off through the foliage. han what, chewie? what? chewie! the others rush to keep up with the giant wookiee. as he scoots along, artoo whistles nervously. 71 ext forest - dense foliage the group has reached a break in the undergrowth. chewie walks up to a tall stake planted in the ground. there is a dead animal hanging from it. han hey, i don't get it. the rest of the group joins the wookiee around the stake. han (cont) nah, it's just a dead animal, chewie. chewie can't resist. he reaches toward the meat. luke chewie, wa-wait! don't! too late. the wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. sprooing! the group finds itself hanging upside down in an ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. artoo lets out a wild series of beeps and whistles, and chewie howls his regret. their bodies are a jumble in the net. han removes a wookiee paw from his mouth. han nice work. great, chewie! great! always thinking with your stomach. luke will you take it easy? let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) han, can you reach my lightsaber? han yeah, sure. artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. he extends his cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. han is trying to squeeze an arm past threepio to get at luke's lightsaber. the net continues to spin. threepio artoo, i'm not sure that's such a good idea. it's a very long dro-o- op!! artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, crashing to the ground. as they regain their senses and sit up, they realize they are surrounded by dozens of ewoks, each brandishing a long spear. han wha--? hey! point that thing someplace else. han pushes the spear wielded by teebo out of his face and a second ewok warrior comes up to argue with teebo. the spear returns to han's face. he grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol. han hey! luke han, don't. it'll be all right. the ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. luke lets them take his lightsaber. chewie growls at the furry critters. luke chewie, give 'em your crossbow. artoo and threepio are just untangling themselves. threepio gets free of the net and sits up, rattled. threepio oh, my head. oh, my goodness! when the ewoks see threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among themselves. threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. the ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. in a moment, all the ewoks have followed suit. chewie lets out a puzzled bark. han and luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. the ewoks begin to chant at threepio. luke do you understand anything they're saying? threepio oh, yes, master luke! remember that i am fluent in over six million forms of communication. han what are you telling them? threepio hello, i think... i could be mistaken. they're using a very primitive dialect. but i do believe they think i am some sort of god. chewbacca and artoo think that's very funny. han and luke exchange "what next?" looks. han well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? threepio i beg your pardon, general solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. han proper?! threepio it's against my programming to impersonate a deity. han moves toward threepio threateningly. han why, you-- several ewoks' spears are thrust in han's face at the affront to their god. the ewoks move in to protect their god and han is surrounded by a menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. he holds up his hands placatingly. han my mistake. he's an old friend of mine. 72 ext forest - series of shots a procession of ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. their prisoners - han, luke, chewie, and artoo - are tied to long poles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike. each pole is carried on the shoulders of several ewoks. behind the captives, threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the remaining creatures. 73 ext forest walkway - moon forest the procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the giant trees. it stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into nothingness. on the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. the lead ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other ewoks follow suit. 74 ext ewok village square the procession winds its way into the village square. mother ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the newcomers. the group stops before the largest hut. han, luke, chewie, and artoo are still bound to their poles. han is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others are leaned against a tree nearby. threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the pit. he watches with rapt fascination. han, luke, and chewie are less than fascinated. han i have a really bad feeling about this. chewie growls his concern. suddenly all activity stops as logray, the tribal medicine man, comes out of the big hut. he examines the captives carefully, goes to join threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. a larger, gray-haired ewok, chief chirpa, is examining luke's lightsaber with great curiosity. logray speaks to threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy ewoks, pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. the ewoks begin filling the pit under han with firewood. han what did he say? threepio i'm rather embarrassed, general solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. the drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. she sees what's happening at the same moment the prisoners see her. han and luke leia! as she moves toward them, the ewoks block her way with raised spears. leia oh! threepio your royal highness. artoo and chewie chime in with their welcome. leia looks at the assembled ewoks and sighs. leia but these are my friends. threepio, tell them they must be set free. threepio talks to chirpa and logray, who listen and shake their heads negatively. the medicine man gestures toward the prisoners and barks some orders. several ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue with vigor. leia trades frantic looks with luke and han . han somehow, i got the feeling that didn't help us very much. luke threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. threepio but master luke, what magic? i couldn't possibly -- luke just tell them. threepio speaks to the ewoks. the ewoks are disturbed. logray steps forward and challenges threepio. luke closes his eyes and begins to concentrate. threepio you see, master luke; they didn't believe me. just... now the litter/throne, with threepio sitting upon it, rises from the ground. at first threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking. threepio ... as i said they wouldn't. wha-wha-what's happening! oh! oh, dear! oh! the ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. now threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with threepio calling out in total panic at his situation. threepio put me down! he-e-elp! master luke! artoo! somebody, somebody, help! master luke, artoo! artoo, quickly! do something, somebody! oh! ohhh! chief chirpa yells orders to the cowering ewoks. they rush up and release the bound prisoners. luke and han enfold leia in a group embrace. luke notices the spinning threepio, with artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. logray orders the little droid cut down. artoo crashes to the ground. when the ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. the ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. a small group of ewoks surround the giant wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his height. threepio oh, oh, oh, oh! thank goodness. luke thanks, threepio. threepio (still shaken) i...i never knew i had it in me. 75 int chief's hut - council of elders a glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. along one side, a group of ten ewok elders flank chief chirpa, who sits on his throne. the rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with threepio between the two groups and wicket and teebo off to one side. threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the ewok's squeaky native tongue. the ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. threepio points several times at the rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the galactic civil war, mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating imperial walkers. throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable in english: princess leia, artoo, darth vader, death star, jedi, obi- wan kenobi. artoo begins beeping excitedly at threepio. threepio yes, artoo. i was just coming to that. threepio continues with: millennium falcon, cloud city, vader, han solo, carbonite, sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time. at the end of it, the chief, logray, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. the chief stands and makes a pronouncement. the drums begin to sound, and all the ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches. han what's going on? leia i don't know. luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. the others do not notice. threepio wonderful! we are now a part of the tribe. several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the rebels. han just what i always wanted. chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an ewok, while wicket clings to han's leg. han (chuckles) well, short help is better than no help at all, chewie. (to wicket) thank you. okay. threepio he says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. chewie barks. luke has drifted to the back of the hut. now he wanders outside into the moonlight. leia notices and follows. han good. how far is it? ask him. we need some fresh supplies, too. and try and get our weapons back. han pulls threepio back as he keeps trying to translate. han (cont) and hurry up, will ya? i haven't got all day. 76 ext ewok village - night the walkway is deserted now. the windows of the little huts glow and flicker from the fires inside. the sounds of the forest fill the soft night air. luke has wandered away from the chief's hut and stands staring up at the death star. leia finds him like that. leia luke, what's wrong? luke turns and looks at her a long moment. luke leia... do you remember your mother? your real mother? leia just a little bit. she died when i was very young. luke what do you remember? leia just...images, really. feelings. luke tell me. leia (a little surprised at his insistence) she was very beautiful. kind, but...sad. (looks up) why are you asking me all this? he looks away. luke i have no memory of my mother. i never knew her. leia luke, tell me. what's troubling you? luke vader is here...now, on this moon. leia (alarmed) how do you know? luke i felt his presence. he's come for me. he can feel when i'm near. that's why i have to go. (facing her) as long as i stay, i'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) i have to face him. leia is distraught, confused. leia why? luke moves close and his manner is gentle. and very calm. luke he's my father. leia your father? luke there's more. it won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. if i don't make it back, you're the only hope for the alliance. leia is very disturbed by this. she moves away, as if to deny it. leia luke, don't talk that way. you have a power i--i don't understand and could never have. luke you're wrong, leia. you have that power too. in time you'll learn to use it as i have. the force is strong in my family. my father has it...i have it...and...my sister has it. leia stares into his eyes. what she sees there frightens her. but she doesn't draw away. she begins to understand. luke yes. it's you leia. leia i know. somehow...i've always known. luke then you know why i have to face him. leia no! luke, run away, far away. if he can feel your presence, then leave this place. i wish i could go with you. luke no, you don't. you've always been strong. leia but, why must you confront him? luke because...there is good in him. i've felt it. he won't turn me over to the emperor. i can save him. i can turn him back to the good side. i have to try. they hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister. leia holds back her tears as luke slowly lets her go and moves away. he disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as han comes out of the chief's hut and comes over to her. leia is crying, her body trembling. he realizes only now that she is crying. han hey, what's goin' on? leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes. leia nothing. i - just want to be alone for a little while. han (angry) nothing? come on, tell me. what's goin' on? she looks up at him, struggling to control herself. leia i...i can't tell you. han (loses his temper) did you tell luke? is that who you could tell? leia i... han ahhh... he starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her. han i'm sorry. leia hold me. han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace. 77 ext forest - imperial landing platform an imperial shuttle floats down from the death star and lands gracefully on the huge platform. now, an imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of the forest. the whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty. 78 ext imperial landing platform - lower deck darth vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. he walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with luke, in binders, at their center. the young jedi gazes at vader with complete calm. commander this is a rebel that surrendered to us. although he denies it, i believe there may be more of them, and i request permission to conduct a further search of the area. the commander extends his hand, revealing luke's lightsaber. commander he was armed only with this. vader looks at luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the lightsaber from the commander's hand. vader good work, commander. leave us. conduct your search and bring his companions to me. commander yes, my lord. the officer and troops withdraw. vader and luke are left standing alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. the sounds of the forest filter in upon them. vader the emperor has been expecting you. luke i know, father. vader so, you have accepted the truth. lure i've accepted the truth that you were once anakin skywalker, my father. vader (turning to face him) that name no longer has any meaning for me. luke it is the name of your true self. you've only forgotten. i know there is good in you. the emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. that is why you couldn't destroy me. that's why you won't bring me to your emperor now. vader looks down from luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved hand. he seems to ponder luke's words. vader (indicating lightsaber) i see you have constructed a new lightsaber. vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, brilliant blade. vader your skills are complete. indeed, you are powerful, as the emperor has foreseen. they stand for a moment, the vader extinguishes the lightsaber. luke come with me. vader obi-wan once thought as you do. luke steps close to vader, then stops. vader is still. vader you don't know the power of the dark side. i must obey my master. luke i will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. vader if that is your destiny. luke search your feelings, father. you can't do this. i feel the conflict within you. let go of your hate. vader it is too late for me, son. the emperor will show you the true nature of the force. he is your master now. vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. he and luke stand staring at one another for a long moment. luke then my father is truly dead. 79 ext endor - ridge overlooking shield generator han, leia, chewbacca, the droids, wicket, and another ewok scout, paploo, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive imperial shield generator. at the base of the generator is an imperial landing platform. leia studies the installation. leia the main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. this isn't gonna be easy. han hey, don't worry. chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. wicket and paploo are chattering away in ewok language. they speak to threepio. leia what's he saying? threepio he says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. 80 ext space - rebel fleet the vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. a giant rebel star cruiser is up at the front, but now the millennium flacon roars up to a spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison. 81 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando is in the pilot seat. his alien copilot, nien nunb, takes some getting used to in the familiar environs of the falcon's cockpit. lando speaks into his comlink. lando admiral, we're in position. all fighters accounted for. ackbar (vo) proceed with the countdown. all groups assume attack coordinates. lando turns to his weird copilot. lando don't worry, my friends are down there. they'll have that shield down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. the copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment. ackbar (vo) all craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. lando all right. stand by. he pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak. 82 ext space - rebel fleet we are treated to an awesome sight: first the millennium falcon, then ackbar's star cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet roars into hyperspace. and disappears. 83 ext endor - ridge overlooking control bunker han, leia, chewie, the droids, and their two ewok guides, wicket and paploo, have reunited with the rebel strike squad. the entire group is spread through the thick undergrowth. below them is the bunker that leads into the generator. four imperial scouts, their speeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. chewie growls an observation, and paploo chatters away to han in ewok language. han back door, huh? good idea. wicket and paploo continue their ewok conversation. han (cont) it's only a few guards. this shouldn't be too much trouble. leia well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. han (with self-confident grin) then we'll do it real quiet-like. threepio explains what is going on to wicket and paploo. the ewoks chatter a moment between themselves. then paploo jumps up and scampers into the underbrush. threepio asks wicket where paploo went and is given a short reply. threepio oh! oh, my. uh, princess leia! leia quiet. threepio i'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. leia oh, no. 84 ext bunker - entrance paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the imperial scouts are lounging. he silently swings his furry ball of a body onto one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at random. suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous roar. paploo grins and continues flipping switches. the scouts leap up in surprise. 85 ext ridge han, leia and company watch in distress. chewie barks. han (sighs) there goes our surprise attack. 86 ext bunker the imperial scouts race toward paploo just as his speeder zooms into motion. paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest. scout look! over there! stop him! three of the imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away in pursuit. the fourth watches them go from his post at the door. 87 ext ridge han, leia, and chewie exchange delighted looks. han not bad for a little furball. there's only one left. you stay here. we'll take care of this. han and the wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. threepio moves to stand next to wicket and artoo. threepio i have decided that we shall stay here. 88 ext forest paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. it's scary, but he loves it. when the imperial scouts pull within sight behind him and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. as he rounds a tree, out of their sight, paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the trees. a moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the still-flying, unoccupied bike. 89 ext bunker han sneaks up behind the remaining imperial scout, taps him on the shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms of the waiting rebel strike team. han returns to the front, and taps out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. everyone stands out of sight, police-style, as the door opens. han and leia peek inside. no sign of life. the group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout behind. 90 int death star - emperor's throne room the elevator opens. vader and luke enter the room alone. they walk across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side by side beneath the gaze of the emperor. vader bows to his master. emperor welcome, young skywalker. i have been expecting you. luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. the emperor then looks down at luke's binders. emperor you no longer need those. the emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and luke's binders fall away, clattering to the floor. luke looks down at his own hands, free now to reach out and grab the emperor's neck. he does nothing. emperor guards, leave us. the red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator. emperor (to luke) i'm looking forward to completing your training. in time you will call me master. luke you're gravely mistaken. you won't convert me as you did my father. the emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to luke. the emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood. emperor oh, no, my young jedi. you will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. vader his lightsaber. vader extends a gloved hand toward the emperor, revealing luke's lightsaber. the emperor takes it. emperor ah, yes, a jedi's weapon. much like your father's. by now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. so will it be with you. luke you're wrong. soon i'll be dead...and you with me. the emperor laughs. emperor perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your rebel fleet. luke looks up sharply. emperor yes...i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. vader looks at luke. luke your overconfidence is your weakness. emperor your faith in your friends is yours. vader it is pointless to resist, my son. the emperor turns to face luke. emperor (angry) everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. (indicates endor) your friends up there on the sanctuary moon... luke reacts. the emperor notes it. emperor (cont) ...are walking into a trap. as is your rebel fleet! it was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator. it is quite safe from your pitiful little band. an entire legion of my best troops awaits them. luke's look darts from the emperor to vader and, finally, to the sword in the emperor's hand. emperor oh...i'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. 91 int bunker - main control room han, leia, chewie, and the rebel strike team storm through a door and enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner. han all right! up! move! come on! quickly! quickly, chewie. the rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel. leia han! hurry! the fleet will be here any moment. han charges! come on, come on! outside, threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at the door. threepio (to wicket) oh, my! they'll be captured! wicket chatters in ewok language, and then takes off full steam into the forest. threepio wa-wait! wait, come back! artoo, stay with me. inside the bunker, han looks up from setting charges as an imperial commander enters. commander freeze! you rebel scum. han and leia spin, to find dozens of imperial weapons trained on them and their cohorts. a poised force of imperial troops surround them. even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the rebel contingent. han, leia, and chewie exchange looks. they're helpless. 92 ext space - endor, death star, rebel fleet the death star and its sanctuary moon hang distant in space as the rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. the millennium falcon and several rebel fighters are at the front as the space armada bears down on its target. 93 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio. lando all wings report in. wedge red leader standing by. gray leader gray leader standing by. green leader green leader standing by. wedge lock s-foils in attack positions. 94 int rebel star cruiser - bridge from the bridge of the rebel headquarters frigate, admiral ackbar watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen. ackbar may the force be with us. 95 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, nien nunb, who points to the control panel and talks to lando. lando we've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching death star as the implications of what he's just said sink in. he hits a switch on his comlink. lando break off the attack! the shield is still up. red leader (vo) i get no reading. are you sure? lando pull up! all craft pull up! the falcon turns hard to the left. out the window the stars and the death star move off right. 96 ext space - death star shield the falcon and the fighters of red squad veer off desperately to avoid the unseen wall. 97 int rebel star cruiser - bridge alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes course abruptly. other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the armada tries to halt its forward momentum. ackbar take evasive action! green group, stick close to holding sector mv-7. a mon calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to ackbar, quite excited. the admiral rushes over to the controller. controller admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47. on the screen can be seen the moon, death star, and the massive imperial fleet. ackbar moves to the comlink. ackbar it's a trap! lando (over comlink) fighters coming in. there is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins. the millennium falcon and several squads of rebel fighters head into an armada of tie fighters. the sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in and around the giant rebel cruisers. rebel pilot there's too many of them! lando accelerate to attack speed! draw their fire away from the cruisers. wedge copy, gold leader. the battle continues around the giant cruisers. 98 int death star - emperor's throne room through the round window behind the emperor's throne can be seen the distant flashes of the space battle in progress. emperor come, boy. see for yourself. the emperor is sitting in his throne, with vader standing at his side. luke moves to look through a small section of the window. emperor from here you will witness the final destruction of the alliance, and the end of your insignificant rebellion. luke is in torment. he glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest of the throne. the emperor watches him and smiles, touches the lightsaber. emperor you want this, don't you? the hate is swelling in you now. take your jedi weapon. use it. i am unarmed. strike me down with it. give in to your anger. with each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. vader watches luke in his agony. luke no! emperor it is unavoidable. it is your destiny. you, like your father, are now mine! 99 ext forest - generator bunker han, leia, chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the bunker by their captors. the surrounding area, deserted before, is now crowded with two-legged imperial walkers and hundreds of imperial troops. the situation looks hopeless. stormtrooper all right, move it! i said move it! go on! from the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps and whistles. and -- threepio hello! i say, over there! were you looking for me? bunker commander bring those two down here! stormtrooper let's go! artoo and threepio are standing near one of the big trees. as six imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids duck out of sight behind the tree. threepio well, they're on their way. artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? stormtrooper freeze! don't move! threepio we surrender. the stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting quietly to be taken. as the imperial troops move to do that, however, a band of ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them. threepio ohhh! stand back, artoo. in a nearby tree, an ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the ewok attack call. all hell breaks loose as hundreds of ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers. biker scouts dart about blasting ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by ewoks from the trees above. in the confusion of the battle, han and leia break away and dive for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. han goes to the bunker door control panel. leia the code's changed. we need artoo! han here's the terminal. leia (into comlink) artoo, where are you? we need you at the bunker right away. artoo and threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround them. suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. threepio, panicked, runs after him. threepio going? what do you mean, you're going. but-- but going where, artoo? no, what! artoo! oh, this is no time for heroics. come back! biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the little ewoks as the furries scurry for cover. a group of ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. they fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. the walker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. the ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, ewoks drop vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat. a line of ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's foot. as the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind. two speeder bikes chase ewoks through the underbrush. as the scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between two trees. 100 ext space the falcon and other rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat with imperial tie fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the rebel armada. 101 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other rebel squads. lando watch yourself, wedge! three from above! wedge red three, red two, pull in! red two got it! red three three of them coming in, twenty degrees! wedge cut to the left! i'll take the leader! they're heading for the medical frigate. lando steers the falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at the ties from the belly guns. navigator pressure's steady. the copilot nien nunb chatters an observation. lando only the fighters are attacking. i wonder what those star destroyers are waiting for. 102 ext space - imperial fleet the giant imperial star destroyer waits silently some distance from the battle. the emperor's huge super star destroyer rests in the middle of the fleet. 103 int super star destroyer - bridge admiral piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge window of the super star destroyer bridge. commander we're in attack position now, sir. piett hold here. commander we're not going to attack? piett i have my orders from the emperor himself. he has something special planned for them. we only need to keep them from escaping. 104 int emperor's tower - throne room the emperor, vader, and a horrified luke watch the aerial battle fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. another rebel ship explodes against the protective shield. emperor as you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. (into comlink) fire at will, commander. luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the death star to the rebel fleet beyond. 105 int death star - control room controllers pull back on several switches. commander jerjerrod stands over them. jerjerrod fire! 106 int death star - blast chamber a button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. a hooded imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. a huge beam of light emanates from a long shaft. two stormtroopers stand to one side at a control panel. 107 ext death star the giant laser dish on the completed half of the death star begins to glow; then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle. 108 ext space - air battle the air is thick with giant ships. in among them, rebel x-wings dogfight with imperial tie fighters. now an enormous rebel cruiser is hit by the death star beam and is blown to dust. the millennium falcon roars over camera, followed closely byseveral tie fighters. 109 int millennium falcon - cockpit the ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the rebel cruiser. lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the death star firepower. lando that blast came from the death star! that thing's operational! (into comlink) home one, this is gold leader. 110 int rebel star cruiser - bridge ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the comlink. ackbar we saw it. all craft prepare to retreat. lando you won't get another chance at this, admiral. ackbar we have no choice, general calrissian. our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. lando han will have that shield down. we've got to give him more time. 111 ext forest - generator bunker artoo and threepio make it to the door, as han and leia provide cover fire. threepio we're coming! han come on! come on! threepio oh, artoo, hurry! the little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. a large explosion hits near artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. the stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and smoldering. suddenly there is a loud sprooing and han and leia turn around to see artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. han rushes to the terminal, as threepio rushes to his wounded companion. threepio my goodness! artoo, why did you have to be so brave? han well, i suppose i could hotwire this thing. leia i'll cover you. ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries. one is hit in the wing with laser fire and crashes. a walker lumbers forward, shooting laser blasts at frantic ewoks running in all directions. two ewoks are struck down by laser blasts. one tries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead. 112 ext space - death star the rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the death star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging imperial star destroyers. 113 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando steers the falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants. he's been yelling into the comlink. lando (desperately) yes! i said closer! move as close as you can and engage those star destroyers at point- blank range. ackbar at that close range, we won't last long against those star destroyers. lando we'll last longer then we will against that death star...and we might just take a few of them with us. the rebel cruisers move very close to the imperial star destroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. tiny fighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire. the control tower of a star destroyer is under attack. rebel pilot she's gonna blow! y-wing pilot i'm hit! the damaged y-wing plummets toward the star destroyer, and crashes into the control tower, exploding. 114 int emperor's tower - throne room out of the window and on the view screens, the rebel fleet is being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. but in here there is no sound of battle. the emperor turns to luke. emperor your fleet has lost. and your friends on the endor moon will not survive. there is no escape, my young apprentice. the alliance will die...as will your friends. luke's eyes are full of rage. vader watches him. emperor good. i can feel your anger. i am defenseless. take your weapon! strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete. luke can resist no longer. the lightsaber flies into his hand. he ignites it in an instant and swings at the emperor. vader's lightsaber flashes into view, blocking luke's blow before it can reach the emperor. the two blades spark at contact. luke turns to fight his father. 115 ext forest the battle rages on. stormtroopers fire on ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs. a walker marches through the undergrowth blasting ewoks as it goes. an ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. the logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash. a scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. the other end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever- tightening circles until it runs out of rope and crashes into the trees with a huge explosion. chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. two ewoks cling to him. they land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. one of the ewoks peeks through the window. walker pilot #1 look! pilot #2 get him off of there! the walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. he is yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. the two ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. the ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. outside, chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of angry barks. the ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to the wookiee's complaint. chewie slips inside the walker. chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other imperial walkers. the ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the battle in their favor. 116 ext forest - generator bunker han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to hotwire the door. he motions to leia, who is blasting away at some stormtroopers. han i think i got it. i got it! the three wires spark as the connection is made. with a loud whoosh, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first. han frowns and turns back to the wires again. leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast. threepio oh, princess leia, are you all right? han let's see. leia it's not bad. stormtrooper (os) freeze! they freeze. threepio oh, dear. stormtrooper don't move! leia holds her laser gun ready, behind han, out of view of the two stormtroopers moving toward them. han and leia's eyes lock; the moment seems suspended in time. han i love you. another shared look between them, as she smiles up at han. leia i know. stormtrooper hands up! stand up! han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in leia's hand. she disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. as han turns back toward leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him. han (to leia) stay back. the hatch on top of the walker opens and chewie sticks his head out and barks triumphantly. han chewie! get down here! she's wounded! no, wait.... i got an idea. 117 int emperor's tower - throne room luke and vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even more vicious then the battle on bespin. but the young jedi has grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack. emperor (laughing) good. use your aggressive feelings, boy! let the hate flow through you. luke looks momentarily toward the emperor, then back to vader, and realizes he is using the dark side. he steps back, turns off his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being. vader obi-wan has taught you well. luke i will not fight you, father. vader walks back up the stairs to luke. vader you are unwise to lower your defenses. vader attacks, forcing luke on the defensive. the young jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. vader stands below him. luke your thoughts betray you, father. i feel the good in you...the conflict. vader there is no conflict. luke you couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and i don't believe you'll destroy me now. vader you underestimate the power of the dark side. if you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to vader's hand. luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the emperor's platform. vader moves to find him. emperor (laughs) good. good. 118 ext space - air battle the two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each other in individual point-blank confrontations. a star destroyer explodes. the rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a series of minor explosions. the rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second star destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the imperial star destroyer with it. the falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger imperial ships. lando watch out. squad at .06. rebel pilot i'm on it, gold leader. wedge good shot, red two. lando now...come on, han, old buddy. don't let me down. 119 int bunker - control room controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an imperial walker pilot can be seen. there is a great deal of static and interference. han/pilot (vo) it's over, commander. the rebels have been routed. they're fleeing into the woods. we need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. the controllers cheer. control room commander send three squads to help. open the back door. second commander yes, sir. 120 ext forest - generator bunker as the door to the bunker opens and the imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by rebels, their weapons pointed at them. ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker. the imperial troops throw down their guns as han and chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges. 121 int bunker - control room han, chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out. han throw me another charge. 122 int emperor's tower - throne room vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, searching for luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready. vader you cannot hide forever, luke. luke i will not fight you. vader give yourself to the dark side. it is the only way you can save your friends. yes, your thoughts betray you. your feelings for them are strong. especially for... vader stops and senses something. luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish. vader sister! so...you have a twin sister. your feelings have now betrayed her, too. obi-wan was wise to hide her from me. now his failure is complete. if you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. luke never-r-r! luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. sparks fly as luke and vader fight in the cramped area. luke's hatred forces vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. each stroke of luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat. the dark lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, luke slashes vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. luke moves over vader and holds the blade of his sword to the dark lord's throat. the emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation. emperor good! your hate has made you powerful. now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. he makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away. luke never! i'll never turn to the dark side. you've failed, your highness. i am a jedi, like my father before me. the emperor's glee turns to rage. emperor so be it...jedi. 123 ext forest - generator bunker han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing. han move! move! a shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes along with the bunker. 124 int rebel star cruiser - bridge ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio. ackbar the shield is down! commence attack on thedeath star's main reactor. lando we're on our way. red group, gold group, all fighters follow me. (laughs) told you they'd do it! the falcon, followed by several smaller rebel fighters, heads toward the unfinished superstructure of the death star. 125 int emperor's tower - throne room luke stands still, as the emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. the emperor's laughter has turned to anger. he raises his arms toward luke. emperor if you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the emperor's hands at luke. even in his surprise, the young jedi tries to use the force to deflect them. at first he is half successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. the wounded vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side. emperor young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the emperor's lightning. he clutches a canister to keep from falling into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him. emperor your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. you have paid the price for your lack of vision. luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward where vader stands watching. luke (groans) father, please. help me. again vader stands, watching luke. he looks at his master, the emperor, then back to luke on the floor. emperor now, young skywalker...you will die. although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. luke's body writhes in pain. vader grabs the emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the dark lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. the emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from luke. now the white lightning arcs back to strike at vader. he stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. he holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. with one final burst of his once awesome strength, darth vader hurls the emperor's body into the bottomless shaft. the emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls into the abyss. finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the bottomless hole. luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety. both the young jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move. 126 ext/int - space battle - fighter and death star rebel fighters follow the falcon across the surface of the death star to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of the giant battle station, followed by many tie fighters. wedge i'm going in. lando here goes nothing. three x-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed by the falcon and four other fighters, plus tie fighters who continually fire at the rebels. lights reflect off the pilot's faces as they race through the dark shaft. lando now lock onto the strongest power source. it should be the power generator. wedge form up. and stay alert. we could run out of space real fast. the fighters and the falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by the tie fighters. one of the x-wings is hit from behind and explodes. lando split up and head back to the surface. see if you can get a few of those tie fighters to follow you. pilot copy, gold leader. the rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the tie's, while lando and wedge continue through the main tunnel. it narrows, and the falcon scrapes the side dangerously. two other tie fighters continue to blast away at them. lando that was too close. nien nunb agrees. the battle between the rebel and imperial fleet rages on. several cruisers fire at the giant super star destroyer. 127 int rebel star cruiser - bridge ackbar we've got to give those fighters more time. concentrate all fire on that super star destroyer. x-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship. 128 int vader's star destroyer - bridge admiral piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the battle. they look concerned. controller sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. piett intensify the forward batteries. i don't want anything to get through. the commander is looking out of the window where a damaged rebel fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge. piett intensify forward firepower! commander it's too late! the rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the star destroyer, causing a huge explosion. the giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the death star, and explodes. 129 int rebel star cruiser - bridge there is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. they cheer as the giant star destroyer blows up. 130 int death star - main docking bay chaos. for the first time, the death star is rocked by explosions as the rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading a heavy barrage. imperial troops run in all directions, confused and desperate to escape. in the midst of this uproar, luke is trying to carry the enormous deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an imperial shuttle. finally, luke collapses from the strain. the explosions grow louder as vader draws him closer. vader (a whisper) luke, help me take this mask off. lure but you'll die. vader nothing can stop that now. just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. slowly, hesitantly, luke removes the mask from his father's face. there beneath the scars is an elderly man. his eyes do not focus. but the dying man smiles at the sight before him. anakin (very weak) now...go, my son. leave me. luke no. you're coming with me. i can't leave you here. i've got to save you. anakin you already have, luke. you were right about me. tell your sister...you were right. luke father...i won't leave you. darth vader, anakin skywalker...luke's father, dies. a huge explosion rocks the docking bay. slowly, luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a shuttle. 131 ext death star the millennium falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense superstructure of the half-built death star. the rebel star cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. and each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station itself. 132 int millennium falcon - cockpit and gun ports lando's crew fires away at the pursuing tie fighters as the dashing baron of bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor shaft. it is awesome. a lone x-wing is just in front of the falcon. wedge there it is! lando all right, wedge. go for the power regulator on the north tower. wedge copy, gold leader. i'm already on my way out. the x-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small explosions. the falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously close, lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the falcon with a powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor. he maneuvers the falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of the continuing chain of explosions. 133 int rebel star cruiser - bridge ackbar and other mon calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, watching the large screen showing the death star in the main briefing room. ackbar move the fleet away from the death star. 134 ext death star an imperial shuttle, with luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the main docking bay as that entire section of the death star is blown away. finally, just as it looks like the falcon will not make it, lando expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and whizzes toward the sanctuary moon, only a moment before the death star supernovas into oblivion. 135 int millennium falcon - cockpit lando and nien nunb laugh and cheer in relief. 136 ext endor forest han and leia, chewie, the droids, the rebel troops, and the ewoks all look to the sky as the death star reveals itself in a final flash of self-destruction. they all cheer. threepio they did it! han looks town from the sky to leia, a look of concern on his face. leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent voice. han i'm sure luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. leia he wasn't. i can feel it. han you love him, don't you? leia smiles, puzzled. leia yes. han all right. i understand. fine. when he comes back, i won't get in the way. she realizes his misunderstanding. leia oh. no, it's not like that at all. he's my brother. han is stunned by this news. she smiles, and they embrace. 137 ext endor forest - night luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. he stands, watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume darth vader -- anakin skywalker. in the sky above, fireworks explode and rebel fighters zoom above the forest. 138 ext ewok village square - night a huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. rebels and ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and liberation. lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by han and chewie. then, finally, luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. they stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's touch, together to the end. rebels and ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. the original group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. only luke seems distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere. he looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at the edge of the shadows: ben kenobi, yoda, and anakin skywalker.

(artoo beeps) three . . . (continuing) four . . . that's not good. obi-wan: anakin, you have four on your tail. anakin: i know. i know! obi-wan: four more closing from your left. anakin: i know. i know! obi-wan: break right and go high. anakin: i'm going low and left. obi-wan shakes his head. obi-wan: (to himself) he still has much to learn. anakin swoops low and skims across a trade federation battleship, dodging flack as artoo bounces along, trying to get out a sentence. anakin: hang on, artoo. obi-wan, do you copy? i'm going to pull them through the needle . . . obi-wan: too dangerous. first jedi rule: "survive." anakin: sorry, no choice. come down here and thin them out a little. obi-wan drops in behind the droid vulture fighters chasing anakin. arfour beeps to obi-wan. obi-wan: just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. obi-wan fires as he swings across the back of the vulture droids, blasting four of them away. anakin heads for a trench along the surface of one of the trade federation battleships. he flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts. obi-wan: (continuing) you'll never get through there, anakin. it's too tight. artoo beeps nervously. anakin: easy, artoo . . . we've done this before. obi-wan: use the force, think yourself through, the ship will follow. artoo squeals in a panic. on the view screen artoo's squeal reads out, "we're not going to make it." anakin: wrong thought, artoo. anakin slips through the narrow gap. the trailing vulture droid fighters crash. anakin: (continuing) i'm through. obi-wan continues to fire on the vulture droid fighters, driving them into the explosion. a clone fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. the clone pilot spins off into space. finally, obi-wan peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside anakin. clone fight squad seven battles the droids. odd ball: there are too many of them. clone pilot 2: i'm on your wing. break left. break left. they're all over me. get them off my . . . anakin: i'm going to go help them out!

pull up! anakin and obi-wan break right and left, and the missiles follow them. anakin does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and explode. two missiles continue to chase obi-wan. he banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. obi-wan: they overshot us . . . the second missile streaks next to obi-wan�s fighter and explodes. obi-wan's ship rocks, and r-4, screams as the starfighter rips through the explosion. debris flies all around them. anakin: they're coming around!

two missiles continue to track obi-wan. obi-wan: flying is for droids. suddenly, obi-wan shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the trade federation cruiser. the trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. the balls pop open, revealing small buzzdroids that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. obi-wan: (continuing) i'm hit! anakin? anakin: i see them . . . buzz droids. the buzz droids crawl across obi-wan's ship and start to tear it apart. sparks erupt where the buzz droids break into the wiring. one of the buzz droids goes after arfour. obi-wan: arfour, be careful. you have one . . . arfour's head gets ripped off and flies away. obi-wan: oh dear. they're shutting down all the controls. anakin: move to the right so i can get a clear shot at them. obi-wan: the mission. get to the command ship. get the chancellor! i'm running out of tricks here. anakin moves into position just off obi-wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the droids crawling over obi-wan�s starfighter. anakin fires and vaporizes the two buzz droids, along with the left wing of obi-wan's ship. obi-wan: (continuing) in the name of ... anakin: steady . . . steady . . . obi-wan: anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. you're not helping here. anakin: i agree, bad idea. swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . obi-wan: wait . . . wait . . . i can't see a thing! my cockpit's fogging. they're all over me, anakin. anakin: move to the right. obi-wan: hold on, anakin. you're going to get us both killed! get out of here. there's nothing more you can do. anakin: i'm not leaving without you, master. anakin moves his ship next to obi-wan's and tries to physically knock the buzz droids off. there are five left. he manages to get one off, but badly dents obi-wan's ship in the process. one of the buzz droids tears apiece off of the front of obi-wan's ship. flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the jedi's view. anakin knocks off three of the buzz droids and the fourth crawls out onto anakin's ship and starts attacking artoo. artoo fights the buzz droid. obi-wan: blast it ... i can't see . . . my controls are gone. anakin: get 'em, artoo. watch out! obi-wan: artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. artoo extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving buzz droid. the buzz droid is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. anakin: yeah, you got him! obi-wan: great, artoo. anakin: stay on my wing . . . the general's command ship is dead ahead. easy . . . pull up ... head for the hangar. obi-wan: have you noticed the shields are still up? anakin: oh?!? sorry, master. anakin streaks ahead of obi-wan's disintegrating jedi fighter and blasts the shield generator. it sparks and explodes. obi-wan: oh, i have a bad feeling about this. 9 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser the shield door drops away, and obi-wan crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a fantail of sparks. a set of blast doors starts slamming shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space. anakin maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors slam shut. obi-wan ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. he jumps dear just as his ship explodes. battle droids rush at him from all directions. anakin jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the battle droids to where obi-wan is fighting. artoo pops out of the ship and follows anakin. obi-wan: artoo, locate the chancellor. anakin: tap into the ship's computers. they cut down the last of the droids and follow artoo over to a computer wall socket. the two jedi fight off four more droids as artoo tries to find the chancellor. finally, a hologram of the trade federation ship appears. obi-wan: the chancellor's signal is coming from right there. the observation platform at the top of that spire. anakin: i sense count dooku . . . obi-wan: i sense a trap. anakin: next move? obi-wan: spring the trap. the jedi start to leave; artoo follows. the jedi stop and turn to artoo. anakin: artoo, go back. i need you to stay with the ship. obi-wan: here, take this, and wait for orders. obi-wan tosses the comlink to artoo. 10 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser general grievous enters the bridge of the trade federation cruiser followed by his two bodyguards. he walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the neimoidian captain. general grievous: what's the situation, captain? captain: two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. general grievous: just as count dooku predicted. 11 int. hangar-trade federation cruiser anakin and obi-wan head for the elevator. a door opens in the hallway and two of general grievous's bodyguards confront the jedi. bodyguard i: general kenobi, anakin skywalker. we've been waiting for you. obi-wan: we are here to relieve you of chancellor palpatine, not join him. as a dozen more droids join the group, the jedi ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back. obi-wan: anakin. . . anakin: ready. anakin and obi-wan use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor. 12 int. generator room-trade federation cruiser the two jedi cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. huge explosions outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. the jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. anakin dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it. obi-wan: . . . fuel. the slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. that's why they've stopped shooting. anakin: well then, we're safe for the time being. obi-wan: your idea of safe is not the same as mine. they run, explosions rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. at the far end, six super battle droids drop into the fuel. the sounds of shield doors closing and locking echo throughout the hallway. they pass several large power generators, which are topped with sparking excess power dischargers. anakin: they're sealing this section off. obi-wan: six droids coming our way! the last of the doors can be heard closing in the distance. anakin: keep moving. there must be vents . . . this way. they move along a wall. anakin climbs up the side to a small vent. the fuel gets closer to the sparking dischargers. obi-wan: we'll never get through that. it's too small! they move toward a second vent. obi-wan is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. anakin feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. he closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. obi-wan is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the super battle droids. it pulls the jedi under the fuel. just before he is about to drown, obi-wan disables the super battle droid by pushing him into an exhaust pipe. the fuel is up to the jedi's chins. anakin finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose. anakin: i found our escape vent. obi-wan: anakin, this is no time for jokes. we're in serious trouble here. anakin: only in your mind. my master. look, no structure. . . . anakin grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. they scramble through it as the droids swim closer. 13 int. vent shaft-trade federation cruiser the two jedi pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube. anakin: here's a way out. as the super battle droids reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the jedi work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch. 14 int. small passageway-trade federation cruiser the two jedi climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. they make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end. 15 int. hallway-trade federation cruiser a hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the trade federation cruiser, and the jedi squeeze out, slamming the hatch. behind them, anakin seals the hatch with his laser sword. obi-wan: that won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers. anakin: the blast will break the hull. this side's pressurized. obi-wan: you still have much to learn, anakin. 16 int. vent shaft-trade federation cruiser the super battle droids climb up the vent shaft. super battle droid r77 and several other droids wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger. super battle droid r77: i have a bad feeling about this. 17 int. generator room-trade federation cruiser the fuel hits the sparking power discharger, and there is a huge explosion. 18 ext. trade federation cruiser-battle a great explosion and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the federation cruiser. 19 int. hallway-trade federation cruiser a large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the explosion hits. obi-wan jumps back, then stands amazed. obi-wan: all right, you win. i have much to learn. let's go! anakin grins at obi-wan, and they run down the hallway. 20 int. wide hallway-trade federation cruiser the two jedi wait for an elevator to arrive. they turn around and see they are face to face with three destroyer droids. the droids start blasting away. anakin deflects the bolts. obi-wan frantically pushes the elevator button several more times. anakin: destroyers!! finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. the elevator door slides shut. the jedi turn to see battle droids standing behind them. battle droid: drop your weapons! i said drop 'em. the jedi activate their light sabers and destroy all the battle droids. 21 int hangar-trade federation cruiser r2-d2 notices two super battle droids entering the hangar. he moves and hides behind a jedi starfighter. 22 int. elevator-trade federation cruiser the elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop. obi-wan: did you press the stop button? anakin: no, did you? obi-wan: no! anakin: well, there's more than one way out of here. anakin ignites his laser sword. obi-wan: we don't want to get out, we want to get moving. artoo . . . artoo. do you copy? activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . . anakin cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling. 23 int main hangar-trade federation cruiser two super battle droids are inspecting the jedi starfighters. they overhear obi-wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted. super battle droid 1: what's that? super battle droid 2: get back to work. it's nothing. 24 int. elevator-trade federation cruiser obi-wan: artoo? anakin climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator. obi-wan: (continuing) always on the move. obi-wan continues to talk on the comlink. artoo quietly beeps a reply. 25 int main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo tries to muffle the comlink as the two super battle droids try to figure out where the voices are coming from. artoo extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface. obi-wan: (os) artoo, switch on the comlink. artoo, do you hear me? artoo, we gave you a job to do! artoo. 26 int. elevator shaft-trade federation cruiser suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. anakin quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. he watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. anakin struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as sparking wires rain down on him. 27 int. elevator-trade federation cruiser the elevator starts to descend rapidly. obi-wan: stop, stop! artoo, we need to be going up. 28 int. elevator shaft-trade federation cruiser anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. the door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and two battle droids appear in the doorway and look down at anakin. they point their guns at him. droid 1: hands up, jedi! don't move. droid 2: roger, roger. 29 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser the two super battle droids overhear obi-wan's comlink messages to artoo. super battle droid 1: there it is again. obi-wan: (os) artoo, do you copy? artoo, do you hear me? artoo, we need to be going up, not down. 30 int. elevator-trade federation cruiser the elevator races down as obi-wan holds on. obi-wan: stop. artoo! we need to go up! stop, stop! the elevator stops with a jolt. obi-wan falls to the floor. 31 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser the two super battle droids see artoo and walk toward the little droid. super battle droid 1: hey you! artoo plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up. 32 int. elevator-trade federation cruiser obi-wan stands up after having fallen in the elevator. obi-wan: now, that's better . . . 33 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo is held up by two super battle droids, who chuckle as the little astro droid curses and swings at them. super battle droid 1: you stupid little astro droid! 34 int. elevator shaft-trade federation cruiser anakin looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. he looks at the battle droids leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. he calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft. before anakin can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the droids in two. anakin lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. obi-wan is startled and ignites his lightsaber. obi-wan: oh, it's you . . . 35 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo activates his oil hose and sprays the super battle droids. the super battle droids slip on the oil. 36 int. elevator shaft-trade federation cruiser anakin: what was that all about? obi-wan: well, artoo has been . . . anakin: no loose wire jokes . . . he's doing the best he can. obi-wan: did i say anything? anakin: he's trying! obi-wan: i didn't say anything! 37 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. the super battle droids slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. artoo rolls away. 38 int. general's quarter's-trade federation cruiser the elevator door opens and the two jedi carefully make their way into the main room of the general's quarters. at the far end sits supreme chancellor palpatine. anakin and obi-wan move toward the chancellor. as they get closer to palpatine, they see a very distressed look on the chancellor's face. obi-wan: (bows) chancellor. anakin: are you all right? palpatine: (quietly) count dooku. palpatine makes a small gesture with his hand. obi-wan and anakin turn around. the elevator doors can be heard opening and closing as count dooku strides into the room. he is above the jedi, standing on a balcony, with two super battle droids. the jedi turn to see him. he looks down on the jedi. obi-wan: (quietly to anakin) this time we will do it together. anakin: i was about to say that. count dooku jumps down to the main level. palpatine: get help! you're no match for him. he's a sith lord. obi-wan: chancellor palpatine, sith lords are our specialty. obi-wan and anakin throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers. count dooku: your swords, please, master jedi. we don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor. obi-wan and anakin move toward dooku. obi-wan: you won't get away this time, dooku. obi-wan and anakin charge count dooku. a great sword fight ensues. count dooku: i've been looking forward to this. anakin: my powers have doubled since the last time we met, count. count dooku: good. twice the pride, double the fall. dooku lunges at the jedi and they fall back . . . count dooku: (continuing) your moves are clumsy, kenobi . . . too predictable. you'll have to do better. as the battle proceeds, obi-wan and count dooku are tired. anakin is stronger as he becomes angry. anakin continues to drive the attack on dooku. count dooku throws obi-wan back using the force. anakin and count dooku move up the stairs. as they reach the upper landing of the general's quarters, anakin leaps over count dooku. obi-wan reaches the top of the stairs, destroying two super battle droids. count dooku holds obi-wan in the air using the force as he turns and kicks anakin out of frame. obi-wan is choking. anakin hits the archway. dooku sends obi-wan flying. the jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. count dooku spins around again and, using the force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto obi-wan. anakin spins and kicks count dooku, sending him over the balcony. anakin jumps, following him down to the main floor. count dooku and anakin continue the fight. count dooku: (continuing) i sense great fear in you, skywalker. you have hate, you have anger, but you don�t use them. anakin regains his composure and attacks count dooku as the dark lord continues his spin to meet him head on. their fighting becomes even more intense. anakin attacks count dooku with a new ferociousness. 39 int. general's quarters-trade federation cruiser anakin and dooku continue their fight. it is intense! finally, in one last energized charge, anakin cuts off count dooku's hands. the jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed sith lord's hand. count dooku stumbles to the floor as anakin puts the two lightsabers to his neck. palpatine is grinning as he watches count dooku's defeat. palpatine: good, anakin, good. i knew you could do it. kill him. kill him now! anakin: i shouldn't . . . palpatine: do it!! anakin cuts off count dooku's head. a huge explosion somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. anakin: ... i couldn't stop myself. palpatine: you did well, anakin. he was too dangerous to be kept alive. anakin drops count dooku's lightsaber, moving to palpatine. anakin: yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. anakin raises his hands toward palpatine, who is strapped in the admiral's chair. the chancellor's restraints pop loose. anakin: (continuing) i shouldn't have done that, chancellor. it's not the jedi way. palpatine stands up, rubbing his wrists. palpatine: it is only natural. he cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. it wasn't the first time, anakin. remember what you told me about your mother and the sand people. now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. the ship begins to list to one side. anakin rushes over to obi-wan, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. he kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. palpatine heads for the elevators. palpatine: (continuing) anakin, there is no time. we must get off the ship before it's too late. anakin: he seems to be all right. no broken bones, breathing's all right. palpatine: leave him, or we'll never make it. anakin: his fate will be the same as ours. anakin picks up obi-wan, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators. 40 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser general grievous: prepare for attack. pilot: all batteries fire! fire! 41 int. battlestations-republic cruiser clone gunners fire on the trade federation cruiser and take fire in return. gun emplacements are destroyed. clone troopers go flying. 42 int. elevator lobby-general's quarters-trade federation cruiser anakin carries obi-wan to the elevator doors and hits the button. palpatine joins him. anakin: the elevator's not working, (into his comlink) artoo . . . artoo beeps a response to anakin. anakin: (continuing) . . . activate elevator 3224. suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. palpatine is thrown to the ground. anakin jumps to the door frame of the elevator. anakin looks into the elevator shaft. anakin: (continuing) artoo ... do you copy? artoo, come in! 43 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space. pilot: reverse stabilizers. 44 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser as the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment crash from one side of the ship to the other. several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. artoo starts to slide toward one of the small holes. 45 int. elevator lobby-general's quarters-trade federation cruiser as the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway. anakin clings to the doorframe with obi-wan on his shoulder, as the chancellor struggles to join him. 46 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo continues to skid and slide toward open space. he swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. one of the battle droids stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. artoo beeps a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the battle droids. one bolt hits very near him, and he screams in terror. 47 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser pilot: magnetize! magnetize! 48 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser artoo is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. he falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him. 49 ext. space-coruscant the trade federation cruiser heads straight down toward the planet. 50 int. elevator lobby-general's quarters-trade federation cruiser anakin jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with obi-wan still on his shoulder. anakin: we can't wait. come on, we have to be fast. palpatine climbs into the elevator shaft also. they start running. the ship begins to roll again, and the jedi and the chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other. 51 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser general grievous: fire the emergency booster engines. pilot: leveling out, sir. 52 int. elevator shaft on side-trade federation cruiser anakin still carrying obi-wan on his back, and palpatine run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. anakin cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing anakin and palpatine to start sliding down the shaft. anakin grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. palpatine grabs onto the jedi's leg. as the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft. 53 int. elevator shaft, vertical-trade federation cruiser anakin, obi-wan, and palpatine hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. obi-wan regains consciousness and tries to look around. anakin: easy. . . . we're in a bit of a situation. obi-wan: did i miss something? obi-wan looks down and sees palpatine and the bottomless pit. they hear artoo beeping on obi-wan's comlink. the ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. they hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them. anakinn: hold on. obi-wan: what is that? obi-wan and anakin look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then obi-wan turns to anakin. obi-wan: (continuing) oops. anakin: artoo, artoo, shut down the elevator! obi-wan: too late! jump! they fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. the shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal. anakin and obi-wan take out and throw grappling hooks. the hooks catch and they continue to fall. all the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. the elevator roars by. 54 int. elevator lobby-trade federation cruiser anakin, obi-wan, and palpatine fly through the elevator door and land. obi-wan: let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. come on. anakin: artoo, get down here. artoo, do you copy? 55 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser as the federation cruiser continues to rotate, artoo squeals and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken battle droid parts. he looks around then rockets up out of the debris. 56 int. hallway to hangar bay-trade federation cruiser obi-wan and anakin lead palpatine down a hallway toward the hangar bay. 57 int. doorway to hangar bay-trade federation cruiser it is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. the hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of coruscant. they stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay. obi-wan: none of those ships will get us anywhere. anakin: i agree. palpatine: what are we going to do? anakin: i don't know. obi-wan: don't look at me. i don't know. anakin and palpatine both look to obi-wan. he shrugs his shoulders. anakin's fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. suddenly, the ship turns on its side. anakin: here, chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on. obi-wan: we'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod. anakin hands palpatine the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. palpatine attaches it around his waist. anakin and obi-wan throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes. 58 int. main hangar-trade federation cruiser obi-wan grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. as he moves out into the hangar, two super battle droids start firing at him. the jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the droids, blowing them up. anakin and palpatine follow obi-wan along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. palpatine struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. palpatine loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but anakin manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the chancellor dangles on the other end of the utility cable. they are surrounded by sparks and explosions as the ship twists and tries to break apart. anakin moves out of the steam and struggles to pull palpatine back to safety. anakin is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. the ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. they make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them. 59 int. hangar doorway-trade federation cruiser obi-wan, anakin and palpatine are out of breath. anakin/obi-wan: well, that was close. they laugh. 60 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser bodyguard: general, we found the jedi. they're in hallway 328. general grievous: activate ray shields. 61 int. hallway-trade federation cruiser they run down the hallway. suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway. anakin: ray shields! obi-wan takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment. obi-wan: wait a minute, how'd this happen! we're smarter than this. anakin: apparently not, master. this is the oldest trap in the book . . . well ... i was distracted. obi-wan: oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault. anakin: you're the master. i'm just a hero. obi-wan: i'm open to suggestions here. palpatine: why don't we let them take us to general grievous. perhaps with count dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release. the jedi look at each other in disbelief. anakin: i say . . . patience. obi-wan: patience! that's your plan, is it? anakin: yes, artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . artoo comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. he takes a moment to compose himself. anakin: (continuing) see! no problem. suddenly several doorways open, revealing two destroyer droids. sixteen super battle droids emerge from behind the destroyer droids. artoo turns and zaps one of the super battle droids who then kicks artoo over. super battle droid: don't move, dummy. ouch! zap this. obi-wan: do you have a plan b? 62 ext. bridge-trade federation cruiser obi-wan, anakin palpatine, and artoo are captured by general grievous. they stand before the alien droid general. general grievous: oh yes. general kenobi, the negotiator. we've been waiting for you. that wasn't much of a rescue. a battle droid walks to general grievous and hands him the jedi's lightsabers. obi-wan: that depends upon your point of view. hah! general grievous: and anakin skywalker ... i was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older. anakin: general grievous . . . supreme commander of the droid armies. you're shorter than i expected. general grievous: ahhhh, jedi scum . . . obi-wan: anakin, try not to upset him. we have a job to do. general grievous: your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection. obi-wan: not this time. and this time you won't escape. anakin: artoo. artoo creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around. obi-wan, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the force, yanks his lightsaber out of the general's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. he continues to spin around and cuts anakin free. general grievous: crush them! make them suffer! anakin uses the force to yank his lightsaber out of the general's hand. the droids that surround them begin to fire. obi-wan and anakin jump into the line of fire. the bridge degenerates into chaos. obi-wan and anakin are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with general grievous's two bodyguards. chancellor palpatine is taken away by two battle droids. general grievous walks around the bridge directing the battle droids. general grievous: stay and watch your stations. obi-wan fights one of general grievous's bodyguards. the bodyguard carries an electrified staff about five feet long. when the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. obi-wan is unable to cut the staff. the jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. obi-wan pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the droid bodyguard's head. the droid bodyguard keeps attacking. anakin struggles to defend himself against the other manic droid bodyguard. he cuts the droid bodyguard in half. two battle droids try to take the chancellor away. anakin follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the chancellor. obi-wan finishes off the headless bodyguard. it crumbles to the floor in pieces. alarms sound as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. a pilot yells at general grievous. pilot: sir, we are falling out of orbit. all aft control cells are dead. general grievous: stay on course . . . don't bother with them. keep the ship in orbit. obi-wan and anakin destroy the remaining droids. general grievous retrieves one of the bodyguard's staffs and faces obi-wan. anakin leaps over a console and lands behind general grievous. general grievous: you lose, general kenobi. one of the pilots stands next to the general. pilot: the ship is breaking up! general grievous: we've run out of time. obi-wan tries to get at general grievous. anakin runs at the general from the opposing side. general grievous turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. it breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. general grievous is the first one sucked out into space. he fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. he swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship. obi-wan, anakin, and palpatine hold on for dear life. a blast shield closes around where the window used to be. 63 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser obi-wan continues to fight the battle droids. the droids have backed him into a corner. obi-wan hides behind a control panel as the droids blast away at him. he jumps up and over the droids, cutting most of them down before he lands. he destroys the droids and joins anakin. anakin and obi-wan cut through the rest of the droids as if they were made of butter. palpatine stands in shock as he watches the carnage. droid parts are firing everywhere. obi-wan and anakin stand back to back and cut down the last of the droids just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. sparks begin to fly outside the windows. palpatine: the hull is burning up! 64 ext. hull-trade federation cruiser-space general grievous detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the federation cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. he reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock. 65 int. pod bay-trade federation cruiser-space general grievous enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. the droid general goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod. general grievous: time to abandon ship. general grievous pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned. 66 int. escape pod-space he gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged cruiser. 67 int. bridge-trade federation cruiser obi-wan and anakin go over to the navigator's chair. anakin: all the escape pods have been launched. obi-wan: grievous. can you fly a cruiser like this? anakin: you mean, do i know how to land what's left of this thing? anakin sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. there is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward. obi-wan: well? anakin: under the circumstances, i'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. strap yourselves in. obi-wan and palpatine strap themselves into chairs. anakin struggles with the controls of the ship. the ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. artoo moves in on palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser. obi-wan: steady . . . attitude . . . eighteen degrees. artoo beeps. anakin: pressure rising. we've got to slow this wreck down. open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins. obi-wan: temp steady. hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . . a large part of the ship breaks away. anakin: we lost something. obi-wan: not to worry, we're still flying half the ship. anakin: now we're really picking up speed . . . i'm going to shift a few degrees and see if i can slow us down. obi-wan: careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . . anakin: what's our speed? obi-wan: eight plus sixty-forty. eight plus sixty-twenty. eight plus sixty. temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . . anakin points to one of the controls. artoo beeps madly. anakin: grab that . . . keep us level. obi-wan: steady. steady. anakin: easy, artoo. hang on, this may get a little rough. we lost our heat shields. obi-wan: five thousand. three thousand . . . two thousand. fireships on the left and the right. flreship pilot: we'll take you in. obi-wan: copy that. landing strip's straight ahead. anakin: we're coming in too hot. obi-wan: easy-easy. the ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the coruscant skyline. palpatine and obi-wan hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform. 68 ext. coruscant-industrial landing platform-afternoon a large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by emergency fire speeders. the smoking ship approaches as five fireships spray it with foam. the ship finally makes a rather hard landing. obi-wan: another happy landing. 69 ext. coruscant-senate office building-landing platform-late afternoon the small jedi shuttle carrying palpatine and the jedi arrives at the landing platform. there are a dozen senators, including bail organa, jar jar binks, and c-3po, waiting for them. palpatine, r2-d2, and anakin get out. obi-wan and mace stay in the doorway of the jedi shuttle. anakin: (to obi-wan) are you coming, master? obi-wan: oh no. i'm not brave enough for politics. i have to report to the council. besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. anakin: hold on, this whole operation was your idea. you planned it. you led the rescue operation. you have to be the one to take the bows this time. obi-wan: sorry, old friend. let us not forget that you rescued me from the buzz droids. and you killed count dooku. and you rescued the chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . . anakin: all because of your training, master. you deserve all those speeches of your greatness. obi-wan: . . . the endless speeches . . . anakin, let's be fair. today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. anakin: all right. but you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . . obi-wan: ninth time . . . that business on cato nemoidia doesn't count. i'll see you at the briefing. anakin smiles and walks away from obi-wan. the chancellor and his entourage approach mace. mace wlndu: chancellor palpatine, what a welcome sight! are you all right? palpatine: yes, thanks to your two jedi knights. they killed count dooku, but general grievous has escaped once again. mace wlndu: general grievous will run and hide as he always does. he is a coward. palpatine: that maybe true, but with count dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army, and i assure you, the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive. mace wlndu: then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority. bail, anakin, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the senate building grand hallway. bail organa: skywalker, the republic cannot praise you enough. anakin and bail organa, walking in the hallway. anakin: thank you, senator organa. the kidnapping was a bold move by the separatists, but it was a mistake that obi-wan and i were able to take advantage of. artoo and threepio follow behind the crowd. c-3po: it couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. artoo beeps. c-3po: (continuing) well, there, i agree with you. in fact, i could do with a tune-up myself. 70 int. coruscant-senate office building-main hallway-late afternoon anakin is at the back of the crowd of senators, talking with bail organa. r2-d2 and c-3po scoot along ahead of them. bail organa: the end of count dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the chancellor's draconian security measures. anakin: i wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until general grievous is spare parts . . . the chancellor is very clear about that. behind a row of large columns, a shadowy figure follows the jedi and the senator. anakin senses the figure. bail organa: i'll do everything i can with the senate. anakin: excuse me. bail organa: certainly. anakin stops, and bail goes off after palpatine and the others. anakin goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the shadowy figure, who is revealed to be senator padme amdala. they embrace and kiss. padme: oh, anakin! thank goodness, you're back. anakin: i missed you, padme. i've missed you so. padme: there were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. i've been living with unbearable dread. anakin: i'm back, i'm all right. it feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. and it might have been ... if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. i don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges. anakin starts to give her another kiss. she steps back. padme: wait, not here . . . he grabs her again. anakin: yes, here! i'm tired of all this deception. i don't care if they know we're married. padme: anakin, don't say things like that. you're important to the republic ... to ending this war. i love you more than anything, but i won't let you give up your life as a jedi for me . . . anakin: i've given my life to the jedi order, but i'd only give up my life, for you. padme: (playfully) i wouldn't like that. i wouldn't like that one bit. patience, my handsome jedi . . . come to me later. anakin embraces her, then looks at her. anakin: are you all right? you're trembling. what's going on? padme: i'm just excited to see you. anakin: that's not it. i sense more . . . what is it? padme: nothing . . . nothing . . . anakin: you're frightened. (a little angry) tell me what's going on! padme begins to cry. padme: you've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. i've never felt so alone. there's . . . anakin: . . . is there someone else? padme: (peeved, angry) no! why do you think that? your jealousy upsets me so much, anakin. i do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. nothing has changed. anakin: (sheepish) i'm afraid of losing you, padme . . . that's all. padme: i will never stop loving you, anakin. my only fear is losing you. anakin: it's just that i've never seen you like this . . . padme: something wonderful has happened. they look at each other for a long moment. padme: (continuing) i'm . . . annie, i'm pregnant. anakin is stunned. he thinks through all of the ramifications of this. he takes her in his arms. anakin: that's . . . that's wonderful. padme: what are we going to do? anakin: we're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? this is a happy moment. the happiest moment of my life. 71 ext. utapau-landing platform-day a small neimoidian shuttle lands. battle droids surround the ramp as general grievous descends onto the platform. super battle droid g21 approaches. super battle droid g21: the planet is secure, sir. the population is under control. general grievous: good. where is the separatist council? super battle droid g21: this way, sir ... general grievous takes the elevator to an upper level. he enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows. 72 int. utapau-conference room-grand chamber-day a hologram of darth sidious appears. general grievous: yes, lord sidious. darth sldious: general grievous, i suggest you move the separatist leaders to mustafar. general grievous: it will be done, my lord. darth sldious: the end of the war is near, general, and i promise you, victory is assured. the hologram of sidious talks to grievous about the death of count dooku. general grievous: but the loss of count dooku? darth sldious: his death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. soon i will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than lord tyranus. 73 int. coruscant-padme's apartment-twilight padme stands in the balcony brushing her hair. anakin leans against the wall, watching her lovingly. anakin: . . . every second i was thinking of you. protecting the endless, nameless outer rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . i've never been so happy as i am at this moment. padme: annie, i want to have our baby back home on naboo. we could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. i could go early-and fix up the baby's room. i know the perfect spot, right by the gardens. anakin: you are so beautiful! padme: it's only because i'm so in love . . . anakin: no, it's because i'm so in love with you. padme: so love has blinded you? anakin: well, that's not exactly what i meant . . . padme: but it's probably true! they laugh. anakin: i haven't laughed in so long . . . padme: neither have i. 74 int. polis massa-medical center-dream the view is strangely distorted and disorienting. padme is on a table in an alien medical chamber. she is giving birth and is screaming. padme: anakin, help me! help, anakin! anakin, i love you. i love you. she screams and dies. 75 int. coruscant-padme's apartment-bedroom-night anakin awakens in a panic. he is covered in sweat. he looks over in the bed and sees padme sound asleep next to him. anakin gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. he is breathing heavily. he puts his head in his hands and weeps. he regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. padme awakens, realizes anakin is gone. padme: anakin?? she gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him. 76 ext. coruscant-padme's apartment-veranda-night anakin walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. the vast city planet of coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. he is distraught. padme descends the stairs and joins anakin on the veranda. she takes his hand. he doesn't look at her. padme: what's bothering you? anakin: nothing . . . anakin touches the japor snippet around padme's neck, that anakin gave her when he was a small boy. anakin: (continuing) i remember when i gave this to you. padme: anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other? anakin: it was a dream. padme: bad? anakin: like the ones i used to have about my mother just before she died. padme: and? anakin: it was about you. they look at each other. a moment of concern passes between them. padme: tell me. anakin: it was only a dream. padme gives him a long, worried look. anakin takes a deep breath. anakin: (continuing) you die in childbirth . . . padme: and the baby? anakin: i don't know. padme: it was only a dream. anakin takes padme in his arms. anakin: . . . i won't let this one become real, padme. they embrace, then part. padme: anakin, this baby will change our lives. i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate, and if the council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the jedi order. anakin: i know �. padme: anakin, do you think obi-wan might be able to help us? anakin: (suspicious) have you told him anything? padme: no, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something. anakin: he's been a father to me, but he's still on the council. don't tell him anything! padme: i won't, anakin. anakin: i don't need his help . . . our baby is a blessing, not a problem. 77 int. coruscant-jedi temple-yodas quarters-day yoda and anakin sit in yoda 's room, deep in thought. yoda: premonitions . . . premonitions . . . hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . . anakin: they are of pain, suffering, death . . . yoda: yourself you speak of, or someone you know? anakin: someone . . . yoda: . . . close to you? anakin: yes. yoda: careful you must be when sensing the future, anakin. the fear of loss is a path to the dark side. anakin: i won't let these visions come true, master yoda. yoda: death is a natural part of life. rejoice for those around you who transform into the force. mourn them, do not. miss them, do not. attachment leads to jealousy. the shadow of greed, that is. anakin: what must i do, master yoda? yoda: train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. 78 int. coruscant-jedi temple-hallway-day anakin hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a jedi briefing room. several jedi are exiting. 79 int. coruscant-jedi temple-briefing room-day anakin rushes into the briefing room. by the time he reaches the chamber, the last of the jedi are leaving. only obi-wan remains at the front of the lecture hall. he is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps. obi-wan: you missed the report on the outer rim sieges. anakin: i'm sorry, i was held up. i have no excuse. obi-wan: in short, they are going very well. saleucami has fallen, and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity. anakin: what's wrong then? obi-wan: the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today. anakin: well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. is that bad? it will make it easier for us to end this war. obi-wan: anakin, be careful of your friend palpatine. anakin: be careful of what? obi-wan: he has requested your presence. anakin: what for? obi-wan: he would not say. anakin: he didn't inform the jedi council? that's unusual, isn't it? obi-wan: all of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. you're probably aware that relations between the council and the chancellor are stressed. anakin: i know the council has grown wary of the chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. aren't we all working together to save the republic? why all this distrust? obi-wan: the force grows dark, anakin, and we are all affected by it. be wary of your feelings. 80 int. coruscant-chancellor's office-day anakin stands with palpatine at his window overlooking the vastness of coruscant. several buildings have been destroyed. a brown haze hangs over the landscape. palpatine: anakin, this afternoon the senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the jedi council. anakin: the jedi will no longer report to the senate? palpatine: they will report to me . . . personally. the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. this will bring a quick end to things. anakin: i agree, but the jedi council may not see it that way. palpatine: there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security. anakin: with all due respect, sir, the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments. palpatine: thank you, my friend, but in this case i have no choice . . . this war must be won. anakin: everyone will agree on that. palpatine: anakin, i've known you since you were a small boy. i have advised you over the years when i could ... i am very proud of your accomplishments. you have won many battles the jedi council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. i hope you trust me, anakin. anakin: of course. palpatine: i need your help, son. anakin: what do you mean? palpatine: i fear the jedi. the council keeps pushing for more control. they're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy. anakin: i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic, sir. palpatine: nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. i'm depending on you. anakin: for what? i don't understand. palpatine: to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the republic . . . anakin thinks about this. palpatine: (continuing) anakin . . . i'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council. anakin: me? a master? i am overwhelmed, sir, but the council elects its own members. they will never accept this. palpatine: i think they will . . . they need you more than you know. 81 int. coruscant-bail organa's office-day padme, bail organa, and senators mon mothma, fang zar, terr taneel, and giddean danu sit in senator organa 's office. bail organa: now that he has control of the jedi council, the chancellor has appointed governors to oversee all star systems in the republic. fang zar: when did this happen? bail organa: the decree was posted this morning. padme: do you think he will dismantle the senate? mon mothma: why bother? as a practical matter, the senate no longer exists. giddean danu: the constitution is in shreds. amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day. bail organa: we can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight. everyone looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said. terr taneel: what are you suggesting? bail organa: i apologize. i didn't mean to sound like a separatist. mon mothma: we are not separatists trying to leave the republic. we are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the republic. bail organa: it has become increasingly clear to many of us that the chancellor has become an enemy of democracy. padme: i can't believe it has come to this! chancellor palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. he served as my ambassador when i was queen. glddean danu: senator, i fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the senate. mon mothma: the chancellor has played the senators well. they know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it. bail organa: we can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. senator mon mothma and i are putting together an organization . . . padme: say no more. senator organa. i understand. at this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid. bail organa: yes. i agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing. mon mothma: that means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told. they all nod their heads. padme considers this for a moment. padme: agreed. 82 int. coruscant-jedi temple-hallway outside council chambers-day anakin stands pensively in front of the jedi council chambers. the door opens. 83 int. coruscant-jedi temple-council chambers-day anakin enters and stands in the middle of the room. he is surrounded by the jedi council mace windu, eeth koth obi-wan, yoda, the holograms of plo koon and ki-adi-mundi. mace: anakin skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the council as the chancellor's personal representative. anakin: i will do my best to uphold the principles of the jedi order. yoda: allow this appointment lightly, the council does not. disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine. anakin: i understand. mace: you are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master. anakin reacts with anger. anakin: what? ! how can you do this?? this is outrageous, it's unfair . . . i'm more powerful than any of you. how can you be on the council and not be a master? mace: take a seat, young skywalker. anakin: forgive me, master. anakin goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. everyone is embarrassed. ki-adi-mundi who appears as a hologram, speaks. kl-adi-mundi: we have surveyed all systems in the republic, and have found no sign of general grievous. yoda: hiding in the outer rim, grievous is. the outlying systems, you must sweep. obi-wan: it may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. mace: we cannot take ships from the front line. obi-wan: and yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. yoda: master kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. kl-adi-mundi: what about the droid attack on the wookiees? mace: it is critical we send an attack group there, immediately! obi-wan: he's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. it's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant. anakin: i know that system well. it would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. mace: skywalker, your assignment is here with the chancellor, and kenobi must find general grievous. yoda: go, i will. good relations with the wookiees, i have. mace: it is settled then. yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk. may the force be with us all. anakin is disappointed. 84 int. coruscant-jedi temple-massive main hallway and alcove-late afternoon anakin and obi-wan walk through one of the massive jedi temple hallways. anakin is furious. anakin: what kind of nonsense is this, put me on the council and not make me a master!?? that's never been done in the history of the jedi. it's insulting! obi-wan: calm down, anakin. you have been given a great honor. to be on the council at your age . . . it's never happened before. listen to me, anakin. the fact of the matter is you're too close to the chancellor. the council doesn't like it when he interferes in jedi affairs. anakin: i swear to you, i didn't ask to be put on the council . . . obi-wan: but it's what you wanted! your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off. anakin: that has nothing to do with this. obi-wan: anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation. anakin: you mean divided loyalties. obi-wan: i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor. i was very clear. why didn't you listen? you walked right into it. anakin: the council is upset i'm the youngest to ever serve. obi-wan: no, it is not. anakin, i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. those are not jedi thoughts. they're dangerous, dark thoughts. anakin: master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. i know where my loyalties lie. obi-wan: i hope so . . . anakin: i sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. obi-wan: anakin, the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you. anakin: and? obi-wan: anakin, look, i am on your side. i didn't want to see you put in this situation. anakin: what situation? obi-wan: (takes a deep breath) the council wants you to report on all of the chancellor's dealings. they want to know what he's up to. anakin: they want me to spy on the chancellor? that's treason! obi-wan: we are at war, anakin. the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic, even if the chancellor does not. anakin: why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session? obi-wan: this assignment is not to be on record. the council asked me to approach you on this personally. anakin: the chancellor is not a bad man, obi-wan. he befriended me. he's watched out for me ever since i arrived here. obi-wan: that is why you must help us, anakin. our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. anakin: master, the senate demanded that he stay longer. obi-wan: yes, but use your feelings, anakin. something is out of place. anakin: you're asking me to do something against the jedi code. against the republic. against a mentor . . . and a friend. that's what's out of place here. why are you asking this of me? obi-wan: the council is asking you. 85 ext. coruscant-clone landing platform-day a jedi gunship heads for the huge clone landing platform. 86 int. coruscant-jedi gunship-day yoda, mace, and obi-wan ride in the gunship as it heads for the clone landing platform. mace and obi-wan are sitting. obi-wan : anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm. yoda: too much under the sway of the chancellor, he is. much anger there is in him. too much pride in his powers. mace: it's very dangerous, putting them together. i don't think the boy can handle it. i don't trust him. obi-wan: he'll be all right. i trust him with my life. mace:i wish i did. obi-wan: with all due respect, master, is he not the chosen one? is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force? mace: so the prophecy says. yoda: a prophecy . . . that misread could have been. obi-wan: he will not let me down. he never has. yoda: i hope right you are. and now destroy the droid armies on kashyyyk, i will. may the force be with you. the gunship lands and the ramp lowers. yoda exits the gunship. mace and obi-wan stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the gunship. 87 ext. coruscant-padme's apartment-veranda-sunset padme's speeder pulls up to the landing platform. captain typho escorts padme onto the veranda, where two handmaidens (elle and motee) are waiting. padme turns to captain typho. padme: thank you, captain. captain typho: rest well. my lady. captain typho gets back into the speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. the handmaidens, motee and elle, approach padme as the shadow of a figure moves in the background. c-3po is standing nearby. padme: i'll be up in a while. motee: yes, my lady. c-3po stands, confused, as the handmaidens turn and exit. c-3po: is there anything i might do for you, my lady? padme: yes, make sure all the security droids are working. thank you, threepio. the golden droid turns and exits. padme stands and watches the sunset. the shadowy figure moves toward her. she senses something. anakin: beautiful, isn't it? padme jumps and turns around. padme: you startled me. he sits next to her on the bench. anakin: how are you feeling? padme: he keeps kicking. anakin: he?! why do you think it's a boy? padme: (laughs) my motherly intuition. she puts his hand on her belly. anakin: whoa! with a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl. they laugh. padme: i heard about your appointment. anakin. i'm so proud of you. anakin: i may be on the council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a jedi master. padme: patience. in time, they will recognize your skills. anakin: they still treat me as if i were a padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. padme: anakin . . . anakin: sometimes, i wonder what's happening to the jedi order . . . i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic. padme: have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? anakin: (suspicious) what do you mean? padme: what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? anakin: i don't believe that. and you're sounding like a separatist! padme: anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . now, you're closer to the chancellor than anyone. please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. anakin: (growing angry) don't ask me to do that, padme. make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs. i'm not your errand boy. i'm not anyone's errand boy! padme: what is it? anakin: nothing. padme: don't do this . . . don't shut me out. let me help you. anakin: you can't help me . . . i'm trying to help you. they look in each other's eyes. anakin: (continuing) i sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. padme is startled at this. padme: i sense there are things you are not telling me. padme smiles. anakin is a little embarrassed. padme: (continuing) hold me . . . like you did by the lake on naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... no politics, no plotting ... no war. 88 int. coruscant-galaxies opera house-night anakin lands his speeder and exits. anakin runs up the stairs at the galaxies opera house. anakin runs through the hallway and enters palpatine's box, where the chancellor is sitting with mas amedda and sly-moore, watching the man calamari ballet doing "squid lake." anakin: you wanted to see me, chancellor. palpatine: yes, anakin! come closer. i have good news. our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous. he is hiding in the utapau system. anakin: at last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. palpatine: i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didn't select you for this assignment. you are the best choice by far � but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. anakin: they try. palpatine: sit down, (to his aides) leave us. anakin sits next to palpatine. the chancellor leans over to him. palpatine: (continuing) anakin, you know i'm not able to rely on the jedi council. if they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. anakin: i'm not sure i understand. palpatine: you must sense what i have come to suspect . . . the jedi council want control of the republic . . . they're planning to betray me. anakin: i don't think . . . palpatine: anakin, search your feelings. you know, don't you? anakin: i know they don't trust you . . . palpatine: or the senate . . . or the republic . . . or democracy for that matter. anakin: i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. palpatine: why? they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? anakin doesn't say anything. he simply looks down. palpatine: (continuing) they asked you to spy on me, didn't they? anakin: i don't know ... i don't know what to say. palpatine: remember back to your early teachings. anakin. "all those who gain power are afraid to lose it." even the jedi. anakin: the jedi use their power for good. palpatine: good is a point of view, anakin. and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one. the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the jedi to be. . . anakin: . . . evil. palpatine: . . . from a jedi's point of view. the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force. that is why they are more powerful. anakin: the sith rely on their passion for their strength. they think inward, only about themselves. palpatine: and the jedi don't? anakin: the jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others. palpatine smiles. palpatine: or so you've been trained to believe. why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong? anakin: i'm not sure it's wrong. palpatine: have they asked you to betray the jedi code? the constitution? a friendship? your own values? think. consider their motives. keep your mind clear of assumptions. the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith. anakin is deep in thought. palpatine: (continuing) did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis "the wise"? anakin: no. palpatine: i thought not. it's not a story the jedi would tell you. it's a sith legend. darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. anakin: he could actually save people from death? palpatine: the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. anakin: what happened to him? palpatine: he became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) plagueis never saw it coming. it's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself. anakin: is it possible to learn this power? palpatine: not from a jedi. 89 ext. kashyyyk-day a wookiee catamaran flanked by wookiee helicopters approaches the tree housing the hologram area. 90 int. kashyyyk-hologram area-day yoda and various jedi speak via hologram. the discussion includes obi-wan, mace, agen kolar, yoda- ki-adi-mundi and plo koon. kl-adi-mundi: (holo) palpatine thinks general grievous is on utapau. we have had no reports of this from our agents. mace: (holo) how could the chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? we have had contact with baron papanoida and he said no one was there. anakin: a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of utapau. yoda: act on this, we must. the capture of general grievous will end this war. quickly and decisively we should proceed. obi-wan: does everyone agree? all the jedi concur. anakin: the chancellor has requested that i lead the campaign. they all look at anakin a bit disturbed. mace: (a little peeved) the council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the chancellor. kl-adi-mundi: yes, this decision is ours to make. anakin is embarrassed and becomes sullen. yoda: a master is needed, with more experience. mace: given our resources, i recommend we send only one jedi . . . master kenobi. anakin: he was not so successful the last time he met grievous. obi-wan throws anakin a dirty look. anakin: (continuing) no offense, my master, but i'm only stating a fact. obi-wan: oh no, you're quite right, but i do have the most experience with his ways of combat. yoda: obi-wan, my choice is. kl-adi-mundi: i concur. master kenobi should go. yoda: i agree. all the jedi concur. mace: very well. council is adjourned. anakin is angry. mace: (continuing) obi-wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. if this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him. 91 int. kashyyyk-hologram area-day yoda gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform. clone commander gree: the droids have started up their main power generators. yoda: then now the time is, commander. clone commander gree: yes, sir. the battle begins. 92 ext. kashyyyk-beach head-day a wookiee chieftain lets out a roar as the wookiee army rushes to face the droid army. corporate alliance tank droids race across the water against the wookiees and clone troopers on the beach. droid gunships provide air support, while a spider droid emerges from the watery depths. a brave wookiee places an explosive on a separatist tank and jumps off just before the tank explodes. from the hologram area, yoda observes the ongoing battle. 93 ext. coruscant-padme's apartment-early morning padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of coruscant. 94 int. coruscant-padme's apartment-living room-early morning padme and obi-wan sit on one of the couches. obi-wan: has anakin been to see you? padme: several times . . . i was so happy to hear he was accepted on the jedi council. obi-wan: i know ... he deserves it. he is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted. they laugh. padme: you're not just here to say hello. something is wrong, isn't it? obi-wan: you should be a jedi, padme. padme: you're not very good at hiding your feelings. obi-wan: it's anakin . . . he's becoming moody and detached. he's been put in a difficult position as the chancellor's representative . . . but i think it's more than that. i was hoping he may have talked to you. padme: why would he talk to me about his work? obi-wan studies her. obi-wan: neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either. padme: don't give me that look. obi-wan: i know how he feels about you. padme: (nervous) what did he say? obi-wan: nothing. he didn't have to. padme is a little flustered. she stands and obi-wan follows. she walks to the balcony. padme: i don't know what you're talking about. obi-wan: i know you both too well. i can see you two are in love. padme, i'm worried about him. padme looks down and doesn't answer. obi-wan: (continuing) i fear your relationship has confused him. he's changed considerably since we returned . . . they stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. obi-wan starts to leave. padme stays looking off into the distant city. obi-wan: (continuing) padme, i'm not telling the council about any of this. i ... i hope i didn't upset you. we're all friends, i care about both of you . . . padme: thank you, obi-wan. obi-wan: please do what you can to help him. 95 int. coruscant-padme's apartment-day padme, mon mothma, and five other senators (bana breemu, fang zar. chi eekway, giddean danu, bail organa) sit in padme's living room. c-3po serves drinks to the guests. padme: we cannot let this turn into another war. bail organa: absolutely, that is the last thing we want. mon mothma: we are hoping to form an alliance in the senate to stop the chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all. padme: i know a jedi i feel it would be wise to consult. bana breemu: that would be dangerous. mon mothma: we don't know where the jedi stand in all this. padme: i only wish to discuss this with one . . . one i trust. giddean danu: going against the chancellor without the support of the jedi is risky. padme: the jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . . chi eekway: patience, senator. fang zar: we have so many senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the chancellor. bana breemu: when you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the chancellor, things may change. bail organa: let us see what we can accomplish in the senate, before we include the jedi. padme takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment. 96 ext. coruscant-clone landing platform-day anakin and obi-wan walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where thousands of clone troops and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive republic assault ship. anakin: you're going to need me on this one, master. obi-wan: oh, i agree. however it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. obi-wan starts to turn and leave. anakin: master! obi-wan stops and anakin walks over to him. anakin: (continuing) master, i've disappointed you. i have not been very appreciative of your training . . . i have been arrogant and i apologize . . . i've just been so frustrated with the council. your friendship means everything to me. obi-wan: you are strong and wise, anakin, and i am very proud of you. i have trained you since you were a small boy. i have taught you everything i know. and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than i can remember. but be patient, anakin. it won't be long before the council makes you a jedi master. obi-wan starts down the ramp, then turns back. obi-wan: (continuing) don't worry. i have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of utapau. i think i'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help. anakin: well, there's always a first time. obi-wan laughs. they talk for a few more minutes before anakin watches obi-wan depart. anakin: obi-wan, may the force be with you. obi-wan: good-bye, old friend. may the force be with you. obi-wan heads down a ramp toward the waiting republic cruiser. 97 ext. coruscant-clone landing platform-day the republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space. 98 int. republic battle cruiser-hangar-space clone troopers stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. obi-wan stands next to his blue jedi fighter- talking to several clone commanders with their helmets off. a hologram of the planet utapau is projected by r4-g9 into the middle of the hangar. clone commander cody: fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side. obi-wan: i'll keep them distracted until you get there. just don't take too long. clone commander cody: come on, boss, when have i ever let you down? they laugh. obi-wan: (laughing) cato nemoidia . . . for starters. obi-wan climbs into his jedi fighter. clone commander cody: that was anakin who was late. i believe. obi-wan: very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there. clone commander cody: i'm counting on you. 99 ext. jedi fighter-space obi-wan blasts the blue jedi fighter out of the republic battle cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. he heads for the planet utapau. 100 ext. coruscant-cityscape-chancellor's transport-day the chancellor's transport races through the city and heads for the senate office building landing platform. waiting on the landing platform is a lone jedi. the transport lands, and chancellor palpatine emerges with four royal guards and mas amedda. the four royal guards move off in another direction as palpatine greets anakin, who has been waiting for him. palpatine: well, anakin, did you see your friend off? anakin: he will soon have grievous's head. palpatine: we can only hope the council didn't make a mistake. anakin: the council was very sure in its decision. they exit the landing platform. 101 int. coruscant-senate office building-main hallway-day they enter the main hallway of the senate office building. they pass several senators, including representative jar jar binks from naboo. jar jar: helloo annie. good en to see yousa . . . the gungan waves to anakin. anakin: hi, jar jar. jar jar: oopsin da chancellor!! so sorry, your highness, sir. anakin turns back to the chancellor. palpatine: there are rumors in the senate about master kenobi. many believe he is not fit for this assignment. anakin: not fit? why would anyone think that? palpatine: they say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female senator. anakin: that's ridiculous. who?!? palpatine: (slyly) no one knows who she is ... only that she is a senator. anakin: that's impossible. i would know. palpatine: sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see. anakin becomes worried. palpatine: (continuing) idle senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. i'm sure your master will do fine. 102 int. polis massa-medical center-dream padme calls out in pain. obi-wan is near her and softly speaks to her. obi-wan: save your energy. padme: i can't! obi-wan: don't give up, padme. don't give up . . . 103 int. coruscant-padme's apartment-landing room-day anakin is in the living room, working. he sits on the couch where obi-wan was sitting. padme enters and crosses behind him. anakin: i sense someone familiar . . . obi-wan's been here, hasn't he?

padme: you have been moody lately. anakin: i'm not moody . . . padme: anakin! don't do this again. anakin: i don't know ... i feel . . . lost. padme: lost? what do you mean? you're always so sure of yourself. i don't understand. anakin: obi-wan and the council don't trust me. padme: they trust you with their lives. obi-wan loves you as a son. anakin: something's happening . . . i'm not the jedi i should be. i am one of the most powerful jedi, but i'm not satisfied ... i want more, and i know i shouldn't. padme: you expect too much of yourself. they stop in front of the window in the bedroom. anakin puts his hand on her belly. anakin: i have found a way to save you. padme: save me? anakin: from my nightmares. padme: is that what's bothering you? anakin: i won't lose you, padme. padme: i'm not going to die in childbirth, annie. i promise you. anakin: no, i promise you! i am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the force, i will be able to keep you from dying. padme looks anakin in the eye. padme: you don't need more power, anakin. i believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are. they embrace and kiss. 104 ext. utapau-space obi-wan blasts out of the blue jedi fighter's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet utapau. the blue fighter skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes. 105 int. utapau-landing platform-day obi-wan lands his ship on a platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. all is quiet. a local administrator, tion medon, comes out to greet the ship. obi-wan climbs out of his fighter as a short ground crew looks over his ship. on a ledge above the landing platform, grievous's bodyguards watch as obi-wan talks to tion medon. tlon medon: greetings, young jedi. what brings you to our remote sanctuary? obi-wan: unfortunately, the war. tlon medon: there is no war here unless you've brought it with you. obi-wan: with your kind permission, i should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as i search nearby systems for general grievous. a ground crew rushes out and refuels obi-wan�s fighter. tion medon leans close to obi-wan and speaks quietly. tlon medon: he is here! we are being held hostage. they are watching us. obi-wan: i understand. tlon medon: the tenth level . . . thousands of battle droids . . . obi-wan: tell your people to take shelter. if you have warriors, now is the time. obi-wan starts back toward his starfighter as tion medon leaves the landing platform. grievous's bodyguards retreat from the overhead platform. obi-wan climbs back into his blue jedi fighter. his astro unit (r4-g9) turns to him: obi-wan: (continuing) geenine, take the fighter back to the ship. i'm staying here. tell cody i've made contact. the little astro droid beeps a reply. 106 ext. utapau-observation deck-day on a high balcony, tion medon looks down on the landing platform. a few steps behind him stands one of general grievous's bodyguards. they watch the canopy lower. tlon medon: i told you, all he wanted was fuel. bodyguard: what was his name?

chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip, general, without count dooku. i have doubts about your ability to keep us safe. general grievous: be thankful, viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . your ship is waiting. obi-wan is deep in thought. 112 int. utapau-tenth level-control center-day the jedi removes his cloak and jumps down behind the general. obi-wan: hello, there! general grievous: general kenobi, you are a bold one. i find your behavior bewildering . . . surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) kill him! about a hundred battle droids surround obi-wan, general grievous, and his bodyguards. obi-wan looks around, then walks right up to general grievous. they stare at each other for a moment. general grievous: enough of this. the bodyguards raise their power staffs to knock obi-wan away, but obi-wan ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. the jedi's lightsaber ignites, and obi-wan deftly cuts one bodyguard in two. his staff flies into the air and is caught by general grievous. the other three bodyguards attack obi-wan with an intense fury. obi-wan uses the force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. it drops on the bodyguards, smashing them. obi-wan walks toward grievous, slashing the last bodyguard to pieces. battle droids move toward obi-wan. general grievous: back away. i will deal with this jedi slime myself. obi-wan: your move. general grievous: you fool. i have been trained in your jedi arts by count dooku himself. attack, kenobi. his arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. his four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship. obi-wan: you forget i trained the jedi that defeated count dooku! obi-wan is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. they fight across the control room as the battle droid sharpshooters try to pick off the jedi. obi-wan mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of grievous's hands. a loud explosion is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. general grievous and obi-wan glance to the entrance of the control center and see clone troops in the distance, attacking droids in the sinkhole. on the far wall of the sinkhole, clones can be seen rappelling onto balconies. obi-wan: i may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will. general grievous: army or not, you must realize you are doomed. obi-wan: i don't think so. twenty clones suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. chaos. laser bolts fly everywhere as the droids return fire. obi-wan attacks general grievous, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. obi-wan uses the force to hurl general grievous backwards. he falls onto a lower platform and obi-wan jumps down after him. 113 int. utapau-tenth level-control center-day more clones rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining droids. the jedi cuts down several droids as he races to the entrance of the control center. obi-wan spots general grievous racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. general grievous jumps onto a wheel scooter and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. obi-wan whistles for his lizard boga, who runs to him. obi-wan jumps on. 114 ext. utapau-cliff and landing platform-day the chase begins. obi-wan drops his lightsaber while riding boga. 115 ext. coruscant-senate office building-sunset the sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive senate office building. the sky is red. 116 int. coruscant-chancellor's office-sunset palpatine listens to a delegation from the senate, which includes padme and five other senators: nee alavar, fang zar, maledee, sweitt concorkill, and mon calamari. anakin stands to one side of palpatine. palpatine: i understand your reservations completely, senator, and i assure you the appointment of governors will in no way compete with the duties of the senate. padme: may i take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the constitution? palpatine: i want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, my lady, and when it does i guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . . padme: you are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then. palpatine: you must trust me to do the right things, senator. that is why i am here. fangzar: but surely . . . the chancellor turns on fang zar. palpatine: i have said i will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee. padme: on behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," i thank you, chancellor. palpatine: i thank you for bringing this to my attention, senator. padme gives anakin a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other five senators. palpatine turns to anakin. palpatine: (continuing) their sincerity is to be admired, although i sense there is more to their request than they are telling us. anakin: what do you mean? palpatine: they are not to be trusted. anakin: surely senator amidala can be trusted . . . palpatine: these are unstable times for the republic, anakin. some see instability as an opportunity. senator amidala is hiding something. i can see it in her eyes. anakin: i'm sure you're mistaken. palpatine: i'm surprised your jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things. anakin: i simply don't sense betrayal in senator amidala. palpatine studies anakin carefully and gives him a skeptical look. palpatine: yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. there is much conflict in you, anakin. 117 int. coruscant-jedi war room-early evening ki-adi-mundi, anakin, yoda, mace, clone commander cody, and aayla secura talk via holograms. clone commander cody: master windu, may i interrupt? general kenobi has made contact with general grievous, and we have begun our attack. mace wlndu: thank you, commander. anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. his reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. anakin: yes, master. anakin leaves the room. commander cody's hologram disappears. mace windu: i sense a plot to destroy the jedi. the dark side of the force surrounds the chancellor. kl-adi-mundi: if he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of grievous, then he should be removed from office. mace windu: that could be a dangerous move ... the jedi council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . . kl-adi-mundi: . . . and replace the congress with senators who are not filled with greed and corruption. yoda: to a dark place this line of thought will carry us. hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take. 118 int. coruscant-chancellor's office-early evening anakin brings news to palpatine. anakin: chancellor, we have just received a report from master kenobi. he has engaged general grievous. palpatine: we can only hope that master kenobi is up to the challenge. anakin: i should be there with him. palpatine: it is upsetting to me to see that the council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master? anakin: i wish i knew. more and more i get the feeling that i am being excluded from the council. i know there are things about the force that they are not telling me. palpatine: they don't trust you, anakin. they see your future. they know your power will be too strong to control. anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the jedi have created around you. let me help you to know the subtleties of the force. they walk into the hallway. anakin: how do you know the ways of the force? palpatine: my mentor taught me everything about the force . . . even the nature of the dark side. they stop. anakin: you know the dark side?!? palpatine: anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the jedi. if you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the force. be careful of the jedi, anakin. (pausing) they fear you. in time they will destroy you. let me train you. anakin: i won't be a pawn in your political game. the jedi are my family. palpatine: only through me can you achieve a power greater than any jedi. learn to know the dark side of the force, anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death. anakin: what did you say?

it's over, anakin. i have the high ground. anakin: you underestimate my power! obi-wan: don't try it. anakin follows, and obi-wan cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. anakin tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava. anakin struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. his thin leather glove has been burned off. he keeps sliding down in the black sand. obi-wan: (continuing) . . . you were the chosen one! it was said that you would, destroy the sith, not join them. it was you who would bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness. obi-wan picks up anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. he stops and looks back. anakin: i hate you! obi-wan: you were my brother,
